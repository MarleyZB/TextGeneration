EXT. CROWDED LONDON STREET - DAY
An endless stream of pedestrians crossing the frame.
Cut to a shot looking through pedestrians and reflections of
pedestrians of a Young Man sitting in the window of a coffee
shop, looking out at the people walking past.
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
The following is my explanation...
well, my... my account of... well,
what happened.
The Young Man is tall and slim, mid- to late twenties, with
dark, long, greasy hair and unshaven.
We cut to the Young Man outside, on the street. He is peering
ahead as he walks, as if trying to spot a lost friend.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I’d, ah, been on my own for quite a
while by then and I’d
become...lonely...
A wide shot shows the Young Man amidst a bustling Oxford
Street crowd.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...and bored. Nothing to do all
day, you see. That’s when I began
shadowing.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Shadowing?
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Yeah, shadowing, following. I
started to follow people.
The young man cuts purposefully through the crowd, in slo-mo.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Who?
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Anyone, a stranger, I mean that was
the whole point; following someone
completely at random. Anyone who
wouldn’t know who you were.
The Young Man is staring at someone fixedly as he moves in
slo-mo. His POV shows us a man’s back dodging between other
people, always threatening to lose us, still in slo-mo.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
And then?
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
And then nothing.
We SNAP INTO REAL TIME. The man’s back disappears into the
crowd and we cease to follow him. The noises of the city come
up loud.
The Young Man has come to a virtual standstill. He watches
the world washing around him.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Nothing?
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Nothing. I’d follow somebody for a
while then pick someone else and
follow them or go home or whatever.
The Young Man’s eyes dart about, watching the people around
him. He starts to wander down the road, pulled gently by the
flow of pedestrians.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Why did you do it?
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
How can I explain? Your eyes pass
over the crowd...
We pan across endless anonymous faces.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...and if you let them settle on a
person, then that person becomes an
individual...
We fix on a face, a woman hurrying along.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...just...like...THAT...
SHOCK CUT on the sound of SNAPPING FINGERS at ‘THAT’ to:
2.
INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY
Close on fingers in front of the Young Man’s face. He looks
different: hair short, clean shaven, bruised face, a plaster
over one eye. Seated opposite is an OLDER MAN.
YOUNG MAN
It just became...irresistible.
The Older Man considers this before replying.
OLDER MAN
(suspicious)
So you followed women?
YOUNG MAN
It wasn’t some sex thing. I
followed anyone. Just for the sake
of it, just to see where they went,
what they were doing.
OLDER MAN
You were playing secret agent.
YOUNG MAN
(knows its true, but
doesn’t like it)
No... I’m a writer- I want to be a
writer. I wanted to gather material
for characters, you know, to write
about them. All I did was follow
people- to begin with.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. BUSY STREET IN THE WEST END - DAY
The Young Man (long hair, unshaven) exits a café and stumbles
along the road. His eye is caught by a man passing by in the
opposite direction. The man is in his mid-twenties, tall,
dark haired wearing a dark suit. He is carrying an overnight
bag.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I spotted the dangers soon enough.
I could tell I was hooked and I
made up rules.
The Young Man turns about and starts to follow, speeding up
so as not to lose the fast-moving Dark Suit.
Dark Suit weaves in an out of other pedestrians, his bag
slung over his shoulder, heavy.
3.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...I wouldn’t let myself follow
anyone for too long. I wouldn’t
follow women after dark, stuff like
that, simple things just to keep in
all under control.
The Young Man follows, coming up behind Dark Suit as he waits
at a crossing. The lights change and they head across the
road, the Young Man hanging back slightly.
Dark Suit enters Charing Cross station, the Young Man in
pursuit. Dark Suit crosses the station to the left-luggage
office where he hands his bag to the attendant behind the
counter and takes his ticket. He heads back out of the
station. The Young Man follows.
Dark Suit enters a small doorway between two shops. The Young
Man hangs around nearby, before walking up to the doorway and
examining the doorbells. The bells are for flats up above the
shops; most of the names are not marked. He crosses the road
and looks up at the windows, but can’t see much through any
of them. The Young Man shrugs and starts to walk away, but he
hears a door open behind him and he glances back to see Dark
Suit coming out of a doorway carrying another overnight bag.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
The most important rule was that
even if I found where a person
worked or lived, I would never
follow the same person twice.
Dark Suit looks about as he comes out on to the pavement and
the Young Man is forced to turn back and continue to walk in
the direction in which he was already headed. When he reaches
the corner, he glances back down the street, but the street
is empty. The Young Man looks around thoughtfully before
hurrying off around the corner.
The Young Man rushes through the crowded streets, not quite
running but faster then we’ve seen him move before.
The YOUNG MAN rushes into Charing Cross station and stands
across from the left-luggage office, waiting breathlessly.
Commuters stream across the station, obscuring his view of
the office.
Through a gap in the flow of people the Young Man catches a
glimpse of Dark Suit. The Young Man moves closer, wading
through commuters to get a better look.
He sees Dark Suit hand over his ticket and pick up his first
overnight bag.
4.
Dark Suit slings one bag over each shoulder before heading
off through the station towards the back entrance on to
Hungerford Bridge.
The Young Man follows. They cross the footbridge, trains
rumbling past on the right-hand side, the sky darkening.
They pass through the South Bank Centre and head south,
entering residential streets as it gets dark. Dark Suit
arrives at a small block of flats and lets himself in. The
Young Man sees a light come on in a third-floor window. He
makes a not of the address, turns and walks away.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
It was the most important rule, so
it was the one I broke last.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - DUSK
The Young Man looks up at a second-floor window. His
appearance is dramatically different from the preceding
scene: his hair is in a short, ragged near crew-cut, and he
now wears an old-fashioned dark suit and tie.
The Young Man walks past the row of houses then doubles back
on the opposite side, stopping at a bus stop from which he
can see the houses, He reaches into the inside pocket of his
jacket and takes out a strip of passport photos. He stares at
them, and we see that they are of a young blonde woman,
perhaps the same woman who drew the curtains.
One of the front doors opens and the young blonde woman
exits. The Young Man glaces at the photos in his hand - it is
the same young woman.
The Blonde comes out on to the street. She is wearing a long
overcoat, a purse under her arm.
The Young Man lets her get slightly ahead before tailing her
from the opposite side of the street. The Blonde strides
purposefully ahead, not looking around.
As they enter a more crowded West End street, the Young Man
allows himself to cross onto the same side and move ever
closer.
The Blonde glides through the other pedestrians gracefully
and easily behind her the Young Man bobs and weaves to keep
her in sight.
5.
EXT. SMALL ENTRANCE TO A BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - DUSK
The Young Man approaches and stops outside. The passport
photos are still in his hand. He glances at them as he
replaces them in his inside pocket. He looks at the stairs
down into the club, looks around, rubbing his face.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. STREET IN SOHO - DAY
The Young Man walks down the street, following a middle-aged
bald man. The Young Man has short hair and is wearing a suit
and tie. He is wearing sunglasses and his lip looks swollen.
Baldy stops and turns into a doorway.
The Young Man comes up and examines the names by the bells.
They are all companies/offices.
He looks around, crosses the road and slips into a cafe.
INT. CAFÉ - DAY
The café is empty apart from a woman on her own reading a
book at one of the tables.
The Young Man buys a coffee at the counter and heads over to
the table nearest the window. He sips at his coffee and
glances out of the window to the building opposite.
He takes his dark glasses off and examines his reflection in
the blade of the knife that was sitting on the table. His
left eye is horribly bruised and swollen - it looks halfclosed.
There is a plaster above it, across the eyebrow. His
lip is swollen and marked where it has been recently split.
The Young Man looks up and sees that the lone woman is
staring at him. He puts his sunglasses back on and we:
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. OUTSIDE A BLOCK OF FLATS IN THE WEST END - DAY
The Young Man stares up at the building, perplexed.
Dark Suit comes out of the building, a sports bag slung over
his shoulder. As he walks down the street the Young Man
follows, the throng of people washing around them.
Dark Suit dives into a café.
6.
The Young Man comes abreast of it and looks through the
window. The café is crowded; Dark Suit has taken a table near
the back, facing away from the door. The Young Man looks
about, takes a deep breath and pushes open the door to the
café.
INT. CAFÉ - DAY
Five or six tables, mostly occupied. Two men behind the
counter making the food, one waitress squeezing between the
tables.
The Young Man enters. Keeping an eye on Dark Suit’s back, the
Young Man slides behind a table.
WAITRESS
Yeah?
YOUNG MAN
Coffee, black.
WAITRESS
You’re going to take up one of my
tables over lunch with just a
coffee?
YOUNG MAN
And chips.
He looks up at the waitress; she’s still there.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
And an omlette... please.
The Waitress turns and leaves.
The Young Man looks over to Dark Suit. The sports bag rests
besides Dark Suit’s feet. Dark Suit eats, we can’t see what.
The waitress brings the Young Man’s food. He plays with it as
he considers Dark Suit.
The Young Man gulps at his coffee. Time passes, the other
tables change.
Dark Suit gets up, picks up his bag and turns around, moving
towards the Young Man.
The Young Man studies his half-eaten omelette intently.
DARK SUIT (O.S.)
Mind if I join you?
7.
The Young Man looks up; Dark Suit is at his elbow, smiling.
Dark Suit sits down without waiting for a reply.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D)
(matter-of-fact)
Who and why?
The Young Man looks confused. The Waitress is at their table.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D)
(to Waitress)
Another black coffee for me and...
(to the Young Man)
... What are you having?
The Young Man shakes his head and starts to murmur
negatives. Dark Suit reaches over, picks up the Young Man’s
empty mug and sniffs it.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D)
(to Waitress)
And another coffee...
(he looks into the mug)
... also black.
The Waitress leaves. Dark Suit stares at the Young Man who is
having trouble returning his gaze.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D)
You’re obviously not a policeman,
so who are you and why are you
following me?
The Young Man half-smiles as if he has not understood the
question, then glances from side to side in an attempt to
look uncomprehending.
YOUNG MAN
I’m sorry?
DARK SUIT
You’ve been following me all
morning... why?
YOUNG MAN
Following? I’m sorry but I’ve
absolutely no idea what you’re
talking about-
DARK SUIT
(aggressive)
Don’t piss me off. Who the fuck are
you?
8.
The Young Man can’t think of anything to say. An
uncomfortable silence broken by the Waitress bringing two
coffees.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D)
(to Waitress, eyes still
on Young Man)
Thanks.
(to Young Man)
Sugar?
The Young Man shakes his head. Dark Suit breaks eye contact
to spoon two sugars into his coffee. He stirs it noisily,
looking up expectantly, waiting for the Young Man to speak.
The Young Man’ mouth opens and closes silently several times
before he speaks.
YOUNG MAN
Look I’m not... I haven’t been
following you, I just I just saw
you with your bag and I thought you
looked... interesting.
DARK SUIT
What are you, a faggot?
YOUNG MAN
No! No, I, I, I, I’m a... Look I
saw you on the street and, and you
reminded me of someone I went to
school with- to tell the truth I
thought you were him, so I followed
you and came in here- I came in
here ‘cos I was hungry- but I
wanted to see if it was him...
Dark Suit stares at him.
YOUNG MAN(CONT’D)
(fading)
... but it wasn’t.
DARK SUIT
Why didn’t you just ask me when you
saw me?
YOUNG MAN
I would’ve been embarrassed.
DARK SUIT
(smiling)
Not as embarrassed as you are now.
9.
YOUNG MAN
(laughing nervously)
No, I suppose not.
Dark Suit sips at his coffee. The Young Man follows suit.
DARK SUIT
What’s your name?
YOUNG MAN
Bill.
Dark Suit smiles.
DARK SUIT
Well, ‘Bill’... what do you do?
YOUNG MAN
Actually, I’m kind of-
DARK SUIT
‘Between jobs right now.’
YOUNG MAN
That’s right.
DARK SUIT
What would you do?
YOUNG MAN
I don’t know.
DARK SUIT
(smiling)
Don’t be coy, ‘Bill’. There must be
some burning ambition eating away
at you. You look like some kind of
starving artist?
YOUNG MAN
No.
DARK SUIT
No?
YOUNG MAN
No.
DARK SUIT
Painter?
YOUNG MAN
No.
10.
DARK SUIT
Photos?
YOUNG MAN
No.
DARK SUIT
Films?
YOUNG MAN
No.
DARK SUIT
Writer?
YOUNG MAN
(slight pause)
No.
DARK SUIT
Writer.
YOUNG MAN
NO.
DARK SUIT
But you write?
YOUNG MAN
Not really.
DARK SUIT
But sometimes?
YOUNG MAN
Sometimes, who doesn’t?
DARK SUIT
Me.
(pause)
So you’re a writer.
YOUNG MAN
I didn’t say that. What makes you
think that I’m a writer anyway?
DARK SUIT
Educated, unemployed
twentysomething, fancies himself a
writer... a real leap into the
unknown.
YOUNG MAN
Well, I’m not a writer.
11.
DARK SUIT
But you’re interested in people.
YOUNG MAN
Yeah.
DARK SUIT
This person?
YOUNG MAN
I suppose -
DARK SUIT
You haven’t even asked my name.
YOUNG MAN
What’s your -
DARK SUIT
Or what’s in my bag.
YOUNG MAN
Bag?
DARK SUIT
(gestures at his feet)
My bag. The one you’ve been staring
at.
There is a pause during which Dark Suit stares challengingly
at the Young Man, who looks thoughtfully, undecided.
YOUNG MAN
(sighing)
What’s your name and what’s in your
bag?
Dark Suit smiles, and reaches down for his bag.
DARK SUIT
(dumps bag on table)
My name’s Cobb. Take a look for
yourself.
The Young Man pauses, then, eyes on Cobb, he reaches forward
and pulls the bag across the table. He unzips it and peers
inside.
The Young Man looks puzzled. Cobb grins.
Inside the bag are CDs. Rummaging beneath them the Young Man
uncovers some jewelry and a camera. He looks up at Cobb,
puzzled.
12.
COBB
(smilING)
What were you expecting, drugs?
YOUNG MAN
They’re yours?
COBB
(laughing)
They are now.
YOUNG MAN
Why would you take their old CDs?
COBB
Easy to grab a load, easy to sell,
totally untraceable. A good staple.
The other stuff’s more tricky, far
more unpredictable.
YOUNG MAN
You don’t look like a burglar.
COBB
Sounds like a compliment.
The Young Man shrugs and smiles, zipping up the bag.
COBB (CONT’D)
(grinning broadly)
Interested now?
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. ENTRANCE TO A BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - DUSK
The Blonde approaches, pauses, looking behind herself as if
suspicious of being followed. She goes down the stairs into
the club.
The Young Man (short hair, clean shaven) approaches the
entrance, pauses, uncertain. He looks about, then dives in.
INT. BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - DUSK
Three-sided bar, booths and tables, music.
The Young Man enters. The place is not full. The Blonde is
seated at the bar. She watches the Young Man comes in, then
looks away, uninterested.
13.
The Young Man approaches the bar, leaning on it several
places along from The Blonde, glancing at her out of the
corner of his eye. She is oblivious to his presence, as is
the bartender, who is on the phone behind the bar. The Young
Man sneaks looks at The Blonde whilst tapping the bar,
waiting for the bartender to hang up the phone. The Blonde
has an elegant profile, as seen from along the bar, but she
looks unhappy.
The bartender hangs up the phone, shuffles over and looks
enquiringly at the Young Man.
YOUNG MAN
Beer.
The bartender grabs a bottle from the fridge, opens it and
sets it down in front of the Young Man. The bartender holds
up a glass and raises his eyebrows at the Young Man, who
shakes his head and raises the bottle to his lips, taking a
sip. The Young Man puts the bottle back on the bar and turns
to look at The Blonde. He gets off his barstool and moves
down towards her, sliding his beer along the bar as he goes.
He stops at her side.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Buy you a drink?
THE BLONDE
(staring ahead)
Yeah, but you can’t sleep with me.
The Young Man smiles quizzically.
YOUNG MAN
Why not?
The Blonde turns to look at him, a movement of the head,
nothing else, her expression hard to read.
THE BLONDE
I’m with him.
She jerks her head behind them. The Young Man turns, seeing
three men seated at a table across the room, papers on the
table, apparently talking business. Suits, ties, two of them
young, one middle-aged and bald.
YOUNG MAN
(turning back)
Not that bald one?
THE BLONDE
He’ll let you buy me a drink, but
sex is out of the question.
14.
YOUNG MAN
I see.
THE BLONDE
Still want to buy me that drink?
YOUNG MAN
No.
Right answer, The Blonde laughs. The Young Man sips from his
beer.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
So what’s a beautiful young woman
like you doing -
THE BLONDE
In a place like this?
YOUNG MAN
- with a bald old cunt like that.
THE BLONDE
Long story. Keep your voice down,
he owns this place.
YOUNG MAN
Just trying to get your attention.
You’re interested now aren’t you?
THE BLONDE
(turning away)
No.
The Young Man is disarmed. He looks at the label of his beer
for something to say.
YOUNG MAN
I’m Timothy Kerr - Tim to my
friends.
THE BLONDE
(without looking at him)
So?
The Young Manopens his mouth, pissed off, but changes his
mind before he speaks.
YOUNG MAN
(softly)
You’ve obviously had a bad day, one
of those days which makes you feel
that everybody’s out for their
pound of flesh.
15.
The Blonde turns to look at him, her expression softer, but
not much.
THE BLONDE
(slow, considered
delivery)
That is the kind of day I’ve been
having lately.
She glances out of the corner of her towards Baldy. He is
watching them.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D)
(looking back to Young
Man)
Say something to me.
YOUNG MAN
Such as?
The Blonde slaps the Young Man hard across the face. He looks
shocked.
THE BLONDE
(turning to her drink)
I’ll be outside in ten minutes.
EXT. ENTRANCE TO BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - NIGHT
The Young Man is loitering outside.
The Blonde comes up out of the club and walks towards the
Young Man without appearing even to notice him. He falls into
step beside her. They don’t speak for several paces.
THE BLONDE
Live close?
YOUNG MAN
Yeah. You live, I mean, you do you
live around here?
THE BLONDE
I do. But I don’t want to go back
there.
YOUNG MAN
Because of the bald guy.
THE BLONDE
No.
16.
YOUNG MAN
You want to go to my place?
THE BLONDE
(laughing)
Don’t get your hopes up. I can’t be
seen with you in any of the bars
around here. Got anything to drink
at home?
YOUNG MAN
We can stop on the way.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. CAFÉ - DAY
The Young Man sits alone at a table by the window, watching
the building opposite. He has short hair and wears sunglasses
to hide the worst of his facial bruises, but his swollen lip
is still noticeable.
In front of him on the table are a cup of coffee, a notebook
and a pen. He sips at the coffee.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Young Man’s POV from the café. Baldy exits the building and
hails a taxi.
INT. CAFE - DAY
The Young Man opens the notebook and writes in it, and we:
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO A FLAT, THE LANDING OF A NARROW
STAIRWAY - DAY
Cobb comes up the stairs and stops outside the door.
The Young Man (he has long hair and is unshaven) follows,
standing behind Cobb, looking over Cobb’s shoulder as he
examines the door.
Cobb knocks gingerly on the door. After a pause, he reaches
into his jacket pocket and pulls out a pair of rubber
surgical gloves. He inflates the gloves one after the other
before putting them on, interlacing his fingers and bumping
the gloves snugly into place. He turns to the Young Man.
17.
COBB
(whispering)
Gloves?
The YOUNG MAN nods and holds up his hands for inspection- he
is wearing thick, leather and wool gloves.
Cobb rolls his eyes. Shaking his head, he turns back to the
door, then pushes the Young Man back and lifts up the
doormat. There’s nothing under there, and he lets it back
down. The Young Man leans forward to whisper into Cobb’s ear.
YOUNG MAN
(whispering)
People don’t really do that, do
they?
COBB
(whispering, reaching into
his pocket)
You’d be surprised.
He takes a piece of plastic out and starts working it into
the crack between the door and the frame.
The Young Man notices a potted plant on the windmill. He
reaches over and shifts it slightly, finding a key underneath
it. He taps Cobb on the shoulder and when he turns around the
Young Man holds it up in front of his face. COBB smiles as he
grabs it, and turns back to the door to unlock it.
COBB (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Beginner’s luck.
Cobb opens the door and heads inside, the Young Man
following.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
No lights - cold grey daylight filtered through net curtains.
Cobb is first, creeping forward through the flat with the
Young Man at his shoulder. Cobb looks left and right into
doorways as they advance, pushing them open gently to see
inside to let more light into the hallway. At the end of the
hall Cobb turns to face the Young Man.
COBB
(speaking normally now)
See, nobody home. Right, first
things first. We need a bag.
18.
YOUNG MAN
(whispering)
A bag?
COBB
To carry the stuff out of here. Why
are you whispering?
Cobb passes through a door off to the left.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
A futon, two wardrobes, piles of books and neatly folded
clothes by the wall. Cobb crosses the room to the first
wardrobe and opens it, rummaging around the bottom.
COBB
(head in wardrobe)
Bingo.
COBB backs out of the wardrobe clutching a soft overnight
bag.
YOUNG MAN
(not whispering, but still
quiet)
Don’t you have your own?
COBB
Yeah, sure, it’s a big bag with
‘swag’ written across the side.
OK... what do you fancy?
The Young Man looks around and shrugs.
COBB (CONT’D)
Not much is here of any value.
YOUNG MAN
You don’t seem too concerned.
COBB
I don’t do it for the money.
YOUNG MAN
So why-
COBB
For the adrenalin, and because,
like you, I’m interested in people.
The Young Man raises his eyebrows.
19.
COBB (CONT’D)
You can tell a lot about people
from their stuff. How old would you
say these people were?
The Young Man shrugs.
COBB (CONT’D)
Well, just from the futon you can
make a pretty good guess. Young
people have futons. I’d be
surprised if they were anywhere
near forty with a futon. But
they’ve got one laundry bag so
they’re used to each other which
makes me thing that they’re over
twenty-five.
YOUNG MAN
But if they’re only twenty they
could have been living together for
years.
COBB
Look at the books. They’re educatedwent
to college, graduated when
they were twenty-one or twenty-two,
wouldn’t have moved in with each
other until at least the last year
of college. Get a better idea from
their music.
He starts to examine the shelves, running surgeon’s fingers
across the shelves, touching things without picking them up.
He comes across a wooden box.
COBB (CONT’D)
Here’s the box.
YOUNG MAN
What box?
COBB
Everybody’s got a box. With men
it’s usually a shoebox.
YOUNG MAN
With valuable inside?
COBB
No. More interesting, more
personal. Letters, odd snapshots, a
plastic toy out of a Christmas
cracker, a pebble from some beach.
20.
He opens the box. The Young Man looks over his shoulder.
COBB (CONT’D)
(picking through the
contents)
See? Photos, odd bits of paper,
worthless plastic jewelry. An
unconscious collection. A display.
YOUNG MAN
Display?
COBB
Yes, a display. Each object showing
something about the person,
together adding up to an
illustration of their personality.
We’ve all got something of the
artist inside of us, even if it is
unconscious. It’s extremely
personal. We’re privileged to see
it. People rarely show anyone their
box.
Cobb stares lovingly at the contents of the box for a few
seconds before suddenly throwing it across the room, spilling
the contents everywhere with surprising violence.
YOUNG MAN
(taken aback)
It’s like a diary. They hide it,
but secretly they want someone to
look at it and that’s what I do.
Concealment, display; flip sides of
the same coin. This way they know
that someone’s seen it. That’s what
it’s all about, interrupting
someone’s life, making them think
about all the things they usually
take for granted. That’s what
you’re doing when you steal their
things. When they collect the
insurance money they go out and buy
all these things that have just
been sitting on their shelves,
stuff they’d forgotten they’d
bought, and they have to think all
over again about why they wanted
this stuff, what it’s for. You take
it away and show them what they
had.
21.
He moves to the laundry bag, and reaches into his pocket. He
pulls out a pair of lace panties, holding them up for the
Young Man to see.
COBB
Saucy, eh? I took them from the
last place, two young women sharing
a flat.
The Young Man looks totally baffled as Cobb reaches into the
laundry bag and pulls out a pair of trousers. He stuffs the
panties into the front left pocket and sticks the trousers
back into the bag. COBB heads towards the door, passing the
baffled Young Man.
COBB (CONT’D)
(winking)
Give ‘em something to chat about.
Cobb leaves the bedroom. The Young Man follows.
INT. HALLWAY - DAT
Cobb walks down the corridor carrying the bag, the Young Man
behind him.
YOUNG MAN
Why did you do that?
COBB
(over his shoulder)
She’ll find them in his trousers
and want to know what he’s been up
to.
YOUNG MAN
Why would you want to fuck up their
relationship?
Cobb spins about to face the YOUNG MAN so abruptly that they
almost collide. There is a manic look in his eyes.
COBB
(deadly serious)
Don’t you listen? You take it away
and show them what they had.
The Young Man is speechless. Cobb turns and from in front of
him we can see a mischievous grin break across his face which
is hidden from the Young Man. Cobb dives through a doorway.
The Young Man shakes his head and heads after him.
22.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Cobb is taking two glasses down from the cupboard. There is a
bottle of red wine on the counter.
The Young Man enters.
COBB
Fancy a drink?
The Young Man looks at the bottle then at Cobb.
YOUNG MAN
You’ve got to be joking.
COBB
(rummaging in a drawer)
Don’t be fooled by the supermarket
label - its quite good, I’ve had it
before.
He takes a corkscrew out of the drawer and starts to open the
bottle, his hands smooth and graceful - surgical, almost - in
their white latex sheaths.
COBB (CONT’D)
(levering the cork out)
You’d have trouble doing this with
your gloves on.
He places the corkscrew on the counter and pours two glasses
of wine, handing one to the Young Man who sips at it. Cobb
picks up the corkscrew and starts to remove the cork from it.
YOUNG MAN
So are we going to take anything?
COBB
(placing the corkscrew
back into the drawer)
Anything your heart desires. But
look, that’s not the point, that’s
just work. This is what it’s all
about- being here. Entering
someone’s life, finding out who
they are... just feel it- standing
in someone’s kitchen, drinking
their wine, someone you’ll never
even meet.
He jams the cork into the neck of the bottle and sticks it up
on the shelf.
23.
Just as he does so there is the unmistakable sound of the
front door being opened.
Cobb spins around to face the kitchen door. The Young Man
throws his glass down onto the counter.
We hear a muffled voice through the door.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Drink? I’ve got some wine.
MAN (O.S.)
Why not?
Cobb stands frozen, tense, staring at the door. The Young Man
looks terrified, glancing from the back of Cobb’s head to the
door and back.
YOUNG MAN
(tense whisper)
What the fuck do-
COBB
(hissing)
SHHHHH!
The door swings open and Cobb’s face transforms into an
expression of innocent surprise. A young Woman stands frozen
in the doorway. Cobb steps forward, palms open.
COBB (CONT’D)
(friendly, relaxed)
You startled us! From the agency or
viewing, like us?
As he speaks he has moved right up to the Woman, coming close
enough that she feels compelled to step back into the hall.
The Young Man follows, still looking nervous, but the Woman’s
attention is on Cobb.
WOMAN
(tense, confused)
What are you doing in my flat?
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
The Woman comes into the hall followed by the Young Man. Cobb
turns his attention to the older man who stands frozen in the
hall, looking as nervous as the Young Man.
24.
COBB
(to the woman)
Viewing it. The agent said you’d be
out this afternoon.
WOMAN
(bewildered)
But we’re not moving.
COBB
(to older man, ignoring
Woman)
You must be the man of the house.
You have a lovely home.
The older man looks nervously to the Woman. The Young Man and
Cobb are both now at the door.
COBB (CONT’D)
We’ll leave you in peace, then.
WOMAN
But we’re not moving!
COBB
(opening door, looks
bewildered)
Not even at the end of the month?
WOMAN
NO!
The woman notices their gloves.
Cobb notices her noticing.
COBB
(motioning the young man
out the door)
I should check with the agent,
then, Luv. Sorry to have bothered
you.
Cobb leaves, closing the door in the couple’s bewildered
faces.
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
The Young Man comes out of a doorway onto the flat roof,
hurrying, followed by Cobb. Cobb closes the door behind him.
25.
COBB
Shouldn’t have come back up here.
We’ll have to wait ages before we
go down. Maybe there’s another way
off here.
Cobb starts to look around the edges of the roof.
YOUNG MAN
Jesus shit. You think they believed
you?
COBB
(laughing)
Of course they didn’t fucking
believe me!
YOUNG MAN
So what did-
COBB
I just confused them. We caught
them on the hop.
YOUNG MAN
How do you mean?
COBB
That bloke wasn’t the boyfriend.
Why do you think he didn’t say
anything? They were up to no good
and was probably glad that we
weren’t her boyfriend.
YOUNG MAN
You reckon?
COBB
Definitely. Why else would she be
home from work in the middle of the
afternoon? You just can’t plan for
that kind of shit, we were unlucky.
Don’t be put off. It’s not going to
happen next time.
YOUNG MAN
I’m not so sure.
COBB
(offended)
Oh yeah? Well next time you can do
the prep work.
26.
YOUNG MAN
I didn’t mean that-
COBB
I’m serious. You pick a mark, check
it out to your own satisfaction
days, months, years, whatever- and
that’s what we’ll hit next.
YOUNG MAN
(thoughtfully)
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
COBB
Tell you what.
YOUNG MAN
What?
COBB
I feel bad about pulling the panty
routine on that bloke- she’ll give
him a load of shit, and it’s her
that’s screwing around.
The Young Man laughs, releasing tension.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Small, eclectic mix of stuff. Rubber plant, portable TV,
desk, portable stereo. The Blonde circles the room slowly,
looking at various items, her overcoat still on.
The Young Man enters (he has short hair and is clean-shaven),
carrying two glasses.
The Blonde hasn’t heard him come in. He watches her from the
doorway as she reaches out to touch a ceramic candlestick
sitting on a shoulder-high shelf. As she touches the
candlestick it falls into two pieces. As she grabs at them
she notices the Young Man watching her.
THE BLONDE
(flustered)
I’m sorry, I just touched it, it -
YOUNG MAN
Just came apart in you hands.
THE BLONDE
No, really, it did.
27.
The Young Man smiles as he moves into the room.
YOUNG MAN
I know, it was already broken.
Somebody dropped it, I was going to
glue it...
He grabs two pieces, putting the glasses down on the shelf in
their place.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
... But sod it, I’ll never get
around to it.
He drops the pieces into a waste-paper basket.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
(gesturing at chair)
Take a seat.
The Blonde perches on the edge of a chair, her coat still on.
The Young Man takes a bottle out of a plastic bag, opens it
and pours two measures. He hands The Blonde a drink. She sips
at it. She looks cold.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
So what about the bald guy?
THE BLONDE
What about him?
YOUNG MAN
You’re going out with him.
THE BLONDE
Not exactly.
YOUNG MAN
But you and him are -
THE BLONDE
(matter-of-factly)
I used to have a thing going with
him, but it’s been over for a long
time.
YOUNG MAN
So why did you tell me you were
with him?
THE BLONDE
To get rid of you.
28.
YOUNG MAN
(grins)
So when you decided to have a drink
with me, why did we have to come
here?
THE BLONDE
He still gets jealous, he’s a
dangerous person. And I don’t want
to go to my place right now.
YOUNG MAN
(probing)
Why not?
THE BLONDE
I was burgled yesterday.
YOUNG MAN
Really? What did it feel like, to
find your place broken into?
THE BLONDE
That’s an odd question. Most people
ask ‘What did they take?’
YOUNG MAN
I’m curious about the way people
feel about things.
He moves to the desk, reaching at a black case which sits
amidst the papers and assorted crap.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
I’m a writer.
(opening the case to
reveal an ancient manual
typewriter)
See?
THE BLONDE
(deadpan)
Gosh.
YOUNG MAN
So?
THE BLONDE
So?
YOUNG MAN
How did it feel?
29.
THE BLONDE
(annoyed)
Great. How do you think it felt? I
don’t really want to talk about it,
thank you.
The Young Man shrugs.
YOUNG MAN
Sorry.
He straddles the chair which is in front of the desk. He
leans in towards The Blonde.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
So the bald guy’s dangerous?
THE BLONDE
(laughing)
Christ, you’re a nosy bastard.
YOUNG MAN
Dangerous like how?
THE BLONDE
Dangerous like criminal type,
involved with bad things type
dangerous.
YOUNG MAN
What sort of bad things?
THE BLONDE
The usual: girls, drugs, magazines.
YOUNG MAN
Magazines?
THE BLONDE
And films... pornography. And he
owns a couple of clubs.
YOUNG MAN
Wealthy?
THE BLONDE
Yes. And refined. It took me a long
time to realize the sort of things
which he was capable of.
YOUNG MAN
What sort of things?
30.
THE BLONDE
Perhaps another time. I think I’d
better be going.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Young Man stands at the window, watching people pass by
on the street below. He has short hair and his face is badly
bruised.
He picks up the telephone and dials a number. After a few
rings, the phone is answered by a man we might recognize as
Cobb.
COBB (O.S.)
Yeah?
YOUNG MAN
It’s me... Bill.
COBB (O.S.)
What the fuck do you want?
YOUNG MAN
Advice.
A pause.
COBB (O.S.)
On what?
YOUNG MAN
The job.
COBB (O.S.)
What fucking job?
YOUNG MAN
The one I asked you about.
COBB (O.S.)
Not interested.
YOUNG MAN
(snorting)
I gathered that. I’m doing it on my
own. I wondered about protection.
COBB (O.S.)
Protection?
31.
YOUNG MAN
Self-defence, weapon of some sort.
Surprisingly enough, I thought you
might be able to advise.
Cobb laughs at the other end of the phone.
COBB (O.S.)
Steel whip, nun-chucks - they’re
all right. Tools are good:
sharpened screwdriver, hammer,
chisel -
YOUNG MAN
Hammer?
COBB (O.S.)
Yeah, medium size, good rubber grip
- very nasty. Get a claw hammer you
can pry doors with it. Slip it into
the back of your waistband, you’re
set.
The Young Man’s eyes have glazed over - he doesn’t seem to be
listening.
COBB (O.S.) (CONT’D)
You still there?
The Young Man hangs up without a word and we:
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO A FLAT - DAY
Cobb and the Young Man (he has long hair and is unshaven) are
putting on their gloves.
Cobb looks at the Young Man’s leather gloves.
COBB
Why don’t you get some of these,
for Christ’s sake?
YOUNG MAN
Where do you get them?
COBB
Stole a box from the Middlesex
Hospital, but you can buy them.
He bends down and checks under the doormat. He straightens,
up holding a key.
32.
COBB (CONT’D)
Bing-fucking-go.
He unlocks the door and they step cautiously inside.
INT. DIMLY LIT HALLWAY OF THE FLAT - DAY
Cobb proceeds slowly down the hall, pushing open each
interior door and checking the various rooms. He stops at the
last door.
COBB
You find a bag, I’ll check out the
stuff.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
A small room with an eclectic mix of stuff, rubber plant,
portable TV, desk, portable stereo.
Cobb enters and circles around the room, running his gloved
hands across the mantelpiece, rubber-plant leaves, etc.
The Young Man enters, carrying a sports bag.
YOUNG MAN
Here we go.
COBB
(almost to himself)
That was quick. We may not need
it...
(he looks at the Young
Man)
... there’s fuck-all here.
Tight on the Young Man’s face; he’s really interested.
YOUNG MAN
Oh?
COBB
(sarcastic)
Oh.
The Young Man looks around. Cobb prowls around the room
dangerously.
YOUNG MAN
What about the stereo?
33.
Cobb has stopped at some shelves. Near his shoulder is a
ceramic candlestick, no candle in it.
COBB
How much would you pay for a secondhand,
ten-year-old portable stereo?
You want to carry it, you can have
it. This is fucking useless.
He tips the candlestick off the shelf and on to the floor. It
breaks in two when it hits the floor.
YOUNG MAN
(surprised)
Hey, what are we - vandals or
burglars?
COBB
You’re a burglar? So burgle.
YOUNG MAN
Well... what about the CDs?
Cobb crosses to the small CD rack.
COBB
(interested now)
Not much of a collection.
YOUNG MAN
(drawing him out)
Oh?
COBB
(flipping through CDs)
Very little here. And what there is
seems quite personal.
YOUNG MAN
How’s that?
COBB
There’s none of the music that
people play when their friends come
round, you know, not to be listened
to or even noticed but to fill in
gaps in conversation.
YOUNG MAN
Like what?
COBB
(glances around room)
For someone this age...
34.
(MORE)
I dunno, maybe Simply Red or
Fleetwood Mac, that sort of shit.
YOUNG MAN
He’s got good taste.
Cobb moves over to the desk.
COBB
Each to his own. But he’s a sad
fucker with no social life.
The Young Man raises his eyebrows. At the desk Cobb flips
open a black case to reveal an ancient typewriter.
COBB (CONT’D)
Nice machine.
YOUNG MAN
You think he’s a writer?
COBB
(scoffing)
If he wanted to write he’d have a
word processor. He doesn’t want to
write, he wants to be a writer -
and that’s two...
(notices something)
... two completely different
things.
(turns to Young Man)
You check this out, right?
YOUNG MAN
Right.
COBB
(suspicious)
You watched him come and go, saw
his routine?
YOUNG MAN
(defensive)
I told you, I checked it out. Why?
Cobb turns to the desk and stares at it, hard.
COBB
This guy’s unemployed.
YOUNG MAN
No he isn’t.
35.
COBB (CONT'D)
COBB
(emphatic)
He’s unemployed. Look at this desk,
people with jobs don’t want this
shit in their living rooms!
(rummaging through papers,
files)
This guy is unemployed or a
student... either way he could be
back any fucking second!
YOUNG MAN
(concerned)
Hw won’t. I watched him come and
go, he’s got a job.
COBB
(rummaging)
Yeah? What’s he do, then?
YOUNG MAN
(insistent)
I checked it out.
Cobb stops rummaging, turns around and glares at the Young
Man.
COBB
(malevolent)
What the fuck is this, then?
He holds up a booklet.
COBB (CONT’D)
(controlled anger)
You should recognize this, Doleboy...
(steps forward)
... his fucking UB40.
He grabs the Young Man and throws him against the wall.
He holds the Young Man’s face with his left hand and slaps
the booklet across with the other, hard.
COBB (CONT’D)
Checked it out! You fucking
arsehole, are you trying to get us
thrown in jail? We’re leaving now.
He releases the Young Man, staring at him fro a few seconds
before walking out of the living room. The Young Man rubs his
face before following.
36.
INT. HALL - DAY
The Young man hurtles after Cobb, who is almost at the front
door.
YOUNG MAN
Aren’t we going to take anything?
COBB
We’re going now. I don’t steal from
no-hope dole scroungers. No
offence.
YOUNG MAN
(to himself)
None taken.
Cobb opens the front door and turns to face the approaching
Young Man.
COBB
There’s another place. One that
I’ve checked out...
They leave, closing the door behind them.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - DAY
The Young Man (with short hair and clean-shaven) loiters at
the bus stop, watching The Blonde’s second floor windows. The
curtains are pulled back to reveal The Blonde. She stands at
the window. The front door opens and Baldy steps out.
The Young Man watches Baldy as he walks down the steps on to
the street and turns right, away from the Young Man.
The Young Man waits for a few seconds before walking up to
the front door and ringing The Blonde’s buzzer. The front
door clicks unlocked and the Young Man heads inside.
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BLONDE’S FLAT - DAY
The Young Man comes up to the door and knocks; the door
pushes open slightly with the force of the knock.
THE BLONDE (O.S.)
(from within)
It’s open!
The Young Man enters.
37.
INT. HALL OF A LARGE APARTMENT - DAY
Noise of a shower running, steam coming out of an open
doorway.
The Young Man comes down the hall, cautiously. The Blonde
comes out of a doorway in a bathrobe, glances at him.
THE BLONDE
You’re early.
She disappears into the bathroom before the Young Man has a
chance to reply.
THE BLONDE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Make yourself at home, I’ll be a
minute.
The Young Man comes down the corridor. As he comes past the
bathroom he sees that she has only half-closed the door - he
peers in, but sees only a towel rail and steam. He goes
through the next doorway along.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Expensively and tastefully decorated, almost cluttered - some
pictures on the walls, lots of plants.
The Young Man comes into the room, glances around. He moves
over to a small table by the wall and looks down at it. There
is nothing on it. He runs his fingers over the polished wood
surface, then turns around, looking about the room for
something that he can’t find. He crosses the room and sits
down in a large armchair near the windows.
The Blonde enters, still in her robe, rubbing her wet hair
with a towel.
YOUNG MAN
Nice place.
THE BLONDE
(sitting down on the
couch)
Thanks. I can’t stand the idea that
some stranger was in here,
rummaging around. Creepy.
YOUNG MAN
What’d they take?
38.
THE BLONDE
CD player, CDs, stuff like that.
They took one of my bags to carry
it in - the police told me that
that’s pretty standard.
YOUNG MAN
Must be bad - losing that stuff.
THE BLONDE
(shrugging)
Insurance’ll cover it. The personal
stuff was worse.
YOUNG MAN
Personal stuff?
THE BLONDE
They took some of my things. They
rifled through my underwear.
YOUNG MAN
Probably thought you kept your
valuables hidden there.
THE BLONDE
(shaking her head with
evident distaste)
They took some of it.
YOUNG MAN
Shit. Why would they do that?
THE BLONDE
(mocking)
Come on, don’t play the innocent,
you’re a man - you know the sort of
kinky voyeuristic shit men get up
to.
YOUNG MAN
(shaking his head)
No. No, no, no... I’m not into that
kind of...
THE BLONDE
So you have no interest in women’s
underwear whatsover?
YOUNG MAN
No. I’m interested in what’s inside
it, that’s all.
39.
THE BLONDE
So if I offered you a pair of my
panties, you wouldn’t be remotely
interested?
YOUNG MAN
‘Fraid not, though I’m sure they’re
lovely. Now you’ve embarrassed me
enough, thanks.
THE BLONDE
(shrugging)
Well, they took some. I’ll tell you
what else, they took one of my
earrings - not the pair, just one
of the earrings. Bloody annoying.
YOUNG MAN
Maybe you’ve just misplaced it.
THE BLONDE
No. I know where it was - they took
it... just to fuck me around.
Bloody annoying, they probably
thing they’re really clever. I wear
the one they left on its own.
YOUNG MAN
Why?
THE BLONDE
(shrugs)
Makes me feel good and miserable. I
don’t know, gives me something to
talk about, anyway.
She sighs and looks over to the window.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D)
(rising)
Give me a minute, I’ll get dressed.
She leaves. As soon as she is out of the room the Young Man
jumps out of his chair and lifts up the seat cushion, looking
underneath. He thrusts his hands down the back and sides of
the chair, feeling for something. He comes up empty-handed,
puzzlement on his face, and replaces the cushion.
He goes into the hall and crosses to another doorway.
40.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
The Young Man pauses at the door. It is open a crack and
through the crack he can see into the bedroom.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
The Young Man’s POV through the crack shows us The Blonde
almost dressed, buttoning her blouse in front of the mirror.
The Young Man watches for a second or two, then pushes the
door open quietly.
The Blonde turns her head to look at him, apparently
unsurprised. The Young Man moves towards her. She allows him
to reach out and pull her towards him. He kisses her on the
lips and we:
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING IN SOHO - DAY
The Young Man loiters outside. He has short hair and wears
dark glasses. Baldy exits with another man. They hail a cab
and leave.
The Young Man wanders down an alley running down the side of
the building. He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket on
which a rough floor plan has been drawn.
He counts windows down the side of the building, stopping at
a particular window to study it. He looks around, puts the
paper back into his pocket and walks back out on to the main
street.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Small, dark, cluttered.
The Young Man enters, carrying a paper bag. He removes his
sunglasses, revealing his bruised face.
He tosses the paper bag on to the bed, then reaches into the
breast pocket of his suit jacket and pulls out a pair of
rubber surgical gloves.
He inflates one before stretching it on to his fingers, then
does the same with the second, interlacing his fingers to jam
the gloves on snugly. He flexes his hands, then turns to the
bed and reaches into the paper bag, removing a brand new
hammer with a rubber grip and a claw head.
41.
He tests the weight of the hammer, first in one hand then in
the other. He awkwardly sticks the hammer into the back of
his waistband and moves to the dusty mirror, examining
himself. He removes the hammer from his waistband and looks
at himself holding it in the mirror, and we:
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. INSIDE THE HALL OF A LARGE APARTMENT - DAY
Little is visible in the gloom. All is quiet.
Suddenly a splintering crash breaks the silence and the front
door breaks inward, revealing Cobb and the Young Man (long
hair, unshaven), gloves on, glancing about nervously.
Cautiously, they creep into the flat. Cobb shuts the door
behind them. The Young Man moves to the nearest doorway and
opens the door, spilling a cold, diffuse light into the hall.
He opens the next door along and looks in and we
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Young Man’s POV: expensively and tastefully decorated, almost
cluttered - lots of pictures on the walls, lots of plants.
The Young Man steps back into the hall.
INT. HALL - DAY
The Young Man looks over at Cobb.
YOUNG MAN
(whispering loudly)
Not bad at all.
Cobb turns to look at him.
COBB
(speaking normally)
I’ll check the bedrooms for a bag,
you check out the stuff.
The Young Man nods and passes into the living room.
42.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Young Man enters and crosses to the centre of the large
room. He turns around, scanning the room, taking in
furniture, stereo, plants, TV and VCR, pictures.
Noticing something, he moves closer to a group of pictures on
the wall.
He leans in to study them and his POV reveals a collection of
framed photographs of the same young woman. In some of them
she is obviously posed; the black-and-white ones in
particular look like professionally shot modelling photos.
The Young woman is an attractive blonde.
He stares at the pictures for a few seconds, then turns back
to the room. He crosses to the small table with some framed
photographs on it and leans over to examine the pictures.
They are all of The Blonde. The Young Man picks up one of the
framed photos and looks at it more closely.
COBB (O.S.)
Hey! Take a look in here!
The Young Man places the picture back on the table, keeping
his eyes on it until he has moved several steps towards the
door.
INT. HALL - DAY
The Young Man exits the living room and walks down the
corridor looking into the room for Cobb. He enters a room
near the front door.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Double bed, light, feminine, patterned fabrics and many
cushions, a chest of drawers beneath a framed photograph.
Cobb is standing in front of the chest of drawers, the top
drawer open.
He is holding up a garter belt for the Young Man.
COBB
(mischievous,
conspiratorial)
Saucy lady, n’est-ce que pas?
The Young Man approaches, looking at the photograph above the
chest of drawers - it is The Blonde looking serious.
43.
Cobb turns to the chest of drawers and rummages around.
COBB (CONT’D)
I haven’t found a bag, yet.
The Young Man comes up beside Cobb and looks into the drawer -
it is full of silk panties. Cobb rummages through them. He
looks move interested in the panties than anything he might
find in them.
YOUNG MAN
This is her flat?
COBB
Yeah, and she’s a fox.
YOUNG MAN
But she’s got pictures of herself
everywhere.
COBB
Yeah, and she looks good. Check
this lot out.
He nods his head at the underwear. The Young Man hesitates
and Cobb jerks his head again. The Young Man reaches into the
drawer and feels through some of the silk undergarments. Cobb
grabs a handful, puts them to his nose and inhales deeply,
looking at the Young Man, who shakes his head and smiles
pityingly. They stand there, two piggies at the trough. The
Young Man grabs some of the panties and lifts them up. He
glances up and freezes, seeing the picture of The Blonde
looking down at the them.
COBB (CONT’D)
You should take some.
YOUNG MAN
What?! No way.
COBB
(shrugs)
Suit yourself. I’m going to, she’s
a babe.
He stuffs a handful of silk into his pocket and moves from
the chest of drawers. The Young Man glances at Cobb, then
swiftly pockets some panties when Cobb has turned his back.
The Young Man stares up at the picture of The Blonde as he
backs away.
COBB (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Bingo.
44.
The Young Man turns to see Cobb displaying a large leather
holdall. Cobb turns and points at a pair of pearl earrings on
the dresser. He picks just one of them up and heads into the
hall.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Young Man is stuffing CDs into the leather holdall.
Cobb is slumped in a large armchair, watching.
The Young Man straightens up.
COBB
You should take that CD player.
It’s small enough.
The Young Man grabs the player, pulls wires out of the back
and sticks it into the holdall. He moves over to a small
desk. On the desk lies a set of passport photographs. He
stares at four near-identical images of The Blonde.
YOUNG MAN
(without turning around)
Why does she have so many pictures
of herself?
Cobb looks around the room.
COBB
I think she’s a model. Certainly
vain.
The Young Man slips the passport photos off the desk and into
his pocket. Cobb notices but doesn’t say anything - just
smiles to himself. The Young Man turns around. He avoids
making eye contact with Cobb.
YOUNG MAN
That about it?
Cobb looks lazily over the room.
COBB
I think that covers the useful
stuff.
He hauls himself out of his comfortable chair with a groan.
COBB (CONT’D)
Let’s go.
He holds up the single pearl earring.
45.
COBB (CONT’D)
(mischievous)
I’ll just misplace this for her.
He pulls the seat cushion off the armchair, places the
earring on the chair, dead centre, and replaces the cushion.
EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - DAY
Cobb and the Young Man exit one of the front doors, the Young
Man carrying a full leather holdall.
They turn down the road and walks briskly away.
INT. CHARING CROSS STATION LEFT-LUGGAGE OFFICE - DAY
The Young Man hands over the leather holdall, takes a ticket
and offers it to Cobb.
COBB
(refusing the ticket)
It was your job. You hang on to the
stuff.
They walk out of the station.
EXT. CHARING CROSS STATION - DAY
Cobb and the Young Man talk as they stroll away from the
building.
COBB
Pick it up tomorrow and hang on to
it till I let you know we’re ready
to fence it.
YOUNG MAN
Right.
Cobb looks thoughtfully at the Young Man.
COBB
(seductive, drawing him in
further)
Unless, of course, you want to sell
it yourself and just give me my
half of what you get for it.
YOUNG MAN
Wouldn’t know how to go about it.
46.
COBB
Look, about being hard on you back
at that first place: I won’t let
anyone put me at risk, it’s
dangerous enough already.
They stop, unsure how to proceed.
COBB (CONT’D)
An early supper, I think.
YOUNG MAN
Look, I really can’t afford -
COBB
(smiling)
It’s covered.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Formal, expensive, white linen, mirrors.
The Young Man and The Blonde are seated at a table in one
corner; cosy, intimate. They are having coffee.
THE BLONDE
How was your food?
YOUNG MAN
(looking down)
Fine.
THE BLONDE
So what is it?
YOUNG MAN
You chose this restaurant because
you knew we wouldn’t run into him
here.
THE BLONDE
So?
YOUNG MAN
You said it was over between the
two of you.
THE BLONDE
It is.
47.
YOUNG MAN
Then why -
THE BLONDE
I also said that he’s dangerous.
The Young Man looks at her imploringly.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D)
(pitying but impatient)
Fine. An example. One night he came
back to the flat - my flat - with a
couple of the thugs who work for
him. That meant trouble; right away
I could tell something was going to
happen. Then, a little later this
other man arrives...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE BLONDE’S FLAT, FRONT HALL - DAY
A heavy-set man opens the door to a smaller man and motions
him towards the living room.
THE BLONDE (V.O.)
... you don’t need to know who he
was or anything about him except
that he had cheated them out of
some of their money...
INT. THE BLONDE’S FLAT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Blonde sits in the armchair, smoking, nervous. Baldy and
a heavy-set man welcome the smaller man into the room.
THE BLONDE (V.O.)
... just money, that’s all.
The two heavy-set men grab the smaller man and force him to
the ground spreading his arms out before him, pinning his
wrists to the floor, one of them kneeling on his back.
Baldy brings the hammer down on to a finger with tremendous
force.
The Blonde gets up to leave. Baldy looks up at her, pointing
at her with the hammer.
BALDY
Stay. Watch.
48.
The Blonde stops at the door and turns around. Baldy starts
smashing all of the smaller man’s fingers in turn.
The Blonde closes her eyes and presses her face against the
door frame as if she’s trying to burrow her way out.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The Young Man listens intently.
THE BLONDE
He smashed all of his fingers...
then he split his head open...
CUT TO:
INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Baldy grunts as he brings the hammer down sharply.
Baldy stands up and drops the hammer. There is blood.
The Blonde is crying.
BALDY
Give me a fucking tea-towel or
something.
CUT TO:
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The Young Man is speechless. The Blonde sips at her coffee
before continuing.
THE BLONDE
Dangerous enough for you?
YOUNG MAN
Is it true?
THE BLONDE
Yes.
YOUNG MAN
Christ. You don’t see him any more?
49.
THE BLONDE
(deadpan)
After he messed up my rug like
that?
YOUNG MAN
That’s not funny.
THE BLONDE
I know.
They both sip their coffees. The Young Man looks thoughtfully
at her.
YOUNG MAN
So how did you meet him?
THE BLONDE
Let’s not talk about him -
YOUNG MAN
(bitter)
Did you work for him?
THE BLONDE
(furious)
That’s none of your fucking
business! You’re sick. And a
hypocrite. You loved hearing that
story, you want to hear some more
for your jollies... you’re as bad
as the freak who stole my pants...
(rising from the table)
...well, you can fuck off, you
filthy little shit.
She throws her napkin down, upsetting her water glass, and
strides away from the table. The Young Man grabs the glass,
mopping at the spilt water with the napkin. He looks around
to see if the other diners have noticed (they have). He
catches the waiter’s eye and scribbles in the air for the
bill.
He takes out a credit card. He looks down at it, turning it
over in his hands before laying it down on the table.
The name on the card is Timothy Kerr.
FADE TO BLACK.
50.
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
The Young Man (short hair, sunglasses) glances around before
diving into the side alleyway.
He moves along the building, counting the windows as he goes.
Finding the right one, he pulls his hammer out and levers it
open using the claw. Looking about, he lifts the window and
hauls himself through.
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
Big desk, filing cabinets, couple of chairs.
The Young Man slithers through the window and on to the floor
behind the desk.
He gets on to his haunches and removes his sunglasses,
putting them into his breast pocket. He looks around the
office. It is well lit from the streetlights outside the
windows.
The Young Man moves to the bookshelves and starts to remove
books, stacking them on the floor quickly but quietly.
Halfway through the second shelf he uncovers a safe set into
the wall.
Excited, hands trembling, he removes a piece of paper from
his pocket. It has a series of numbers written on it. He
spins the dial according to the numbers. He tries the door -
it won’t open. He tries the combination again, pulls the door
and this time it swings open to reveal a large stack of
money. The Young Man is shocked by the amount. Next to the
money is an A4 envelope.
YOUNG MAN
Bingo.
He pulls the money and the envelope out of the safe, leaving
it in a pile on the floor. He stands up and looks around.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
(under his breath)
Bag.
He opens the desk drawers, looking in each one. He opens the
closet, searching around, finding nothing.
Increasingly frantic now, the Young Man paces around the
room, peering into every corner, looking behind every piece
of furniture. At length, he stops, exasperated.
51.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
(loud whisper)
FUCK!
He looks at the bundles of banknotes. He looks at the
cluttered desk. There is a roll of masking tape on the desk.
The Young Man steps over, grabs the tape and pulls off a long
strip, breaking it with his teeth and we:
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - DUSK
Understated. Expensive; polished wooden floors, starched
linen, well-dressed clientele. The Young Man and Cobb are
seated at a table near the back of the place.
Cobb eat his good with small, graceful movements. In his dark
suit and tie he fits right in, unlike the Young Man, who is
shabbily dressed, unshaven, has long greasy hair and looks
ill at ease.
Cobb finishes chewing a large bit of his steak, sips from his
glass of water, then dabs his lips gently with his napkin.
COBB
You’re developing a taste for it.
The Young Man looks up from his food.
COBB (CONT’D)
The violating, the voyeurism - it’s
definitely you.
YOUNG MAN
I think not.
COBB
I think so. And I think before long
you’ll develop a taste for the
things you can do with the
proceeds.
YOUNG MAN
Such as?
COBB
(gesturing around them)
This.
YOUNG MAN
You make all of your money that
way.
52.
COBB
(smiling)
Not all of it. You’re going to pay
for this.
YOUNG MAN
But I told you, I can’t afford -
He is silenced by Cobb throwing a credit card on the table.
COBB
It won’t really be you, it’ll be...
(he tilts his head to at
the card)
Timothy Kerr. But I thought I’d
give you the pleasure of pretending
to pay.
YOUNG MAN
But how -
Cobb tosses a pen on to the table next to the card.
COBB
Sign it.
YOUNG MAN
(picking up the card)
Sign it?
He looks at the card. He turns it over; there is no signature
on the white strip. He looks up at Cobb.
COBB
Sign it in your own handwriting and
you can use it for anything. I
wouldn’t use it for more than a day
or two, just to be safe.
YOUNG MAN
(a whisper)
Christ.
The two men smile at each other. The Young Man reaches for
the pen. He signs the back and pockets the card, shaking hsi
head and laughing.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Don’t you worry about being caught?
COBB
Why else would I do it? Besides,
I’m not going to get caught.
53.
YOUNG MAN
You’ve thought it all through.
COBB
(raises wine glass)
I’ve thought it all through.
(pause)
This is just the tip of the
iceberg, I do things you wouldn’t
believe.
YOUNG MAN
Such as?
COBB
An example. Sometimes when I’m
watching a place I’ll see that the
owners are about to go on holiday.
I’ll wait till they’ve gone, then
move in for a week or so.
YOUNG MAN
You’ve got to be joking.
COBB
Happens a lot more often than you’d
think.
YOUNG MAN
But how do you know how long
they’ll be gone for?
COBB
Almost always marked on the kitchen
calendar.
YOUNG MAN
(a whisper)
Christ.
He takes a sip from his win, then shovels a forkful of food
into his mouth. He chews for a second then freezes, his eyes
locked on something at the far end of the restaurant, behind
Cobb.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
(through steak)
Jesus fucking Christ!
Cobb narrows his eyes.
COBB
What’s wrong?
54.
YOUNG MAN
(swallows hard)
The woman, the woman from that
first place, the one who came
home, the, the, the one who saw me -
us... she just walked in.
The Young Man’s POV shows us the young woman from the first
robbery and a man, whom we have not seen before, waiting to
be seated.
COBB
(calm, not turning round)
Are you sure?
YOUNG MAN
Yes, I’m fucking sure!
COBB
(impatient)
Is she with the same bloke?
YOUNG MAN
No.
COBB
We’re all right then.
YOUNG MAN
All right?! What if she sees us?!
COBB
If she sees us, she won’t do
anything. She’s with her partner
now and she won’t want to have to
explain how she found us at their
flat when she was supposed to be at
work.
YOUNG MAN
That’s one hell of a chance to
take!
COBB
(fed up)
Look, just calm down. What would
she do anyway? All we stole was
half a bottle of an indifferent red
wine. Just relax, keep your head.
The Young Man looks at his plate, trying to stay calm.
YOUNG MAN
You mind if we skip dessert?
55.
COBB
(with disgust)
Yes, I fucking mind.
INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Later.
Cobb is scraping up the last of his chocolate mousse. An
almost untouched dessert sits in front of the Young Man, who
repeatedly glances up past Cobb’s head. The Young Man’s POV
shows us the young woman seated with her companion at the
other end of the restaurant.
The young woman pushes her chair back from the table, stands
up, places her napkin on her chair and heads towards Cobb and
the Young Man’s table. The Young Man looks terrified.
YOUNG MAN
She’s coming this way.
Cobb looks up from his chocolate mousse. He nods at a door
off to his left.
COBB
She’s going to the loo, relax.
The Young Man can’t take his eye off the young woman as she
approaches.
She comes near their table. As she turns to the left she
notices the Young Man and looks at him for an instant with
something which might be recognition. She carries on, passing
through the doors to the lavatories.
YOUNG MAN
(losing it)
She fucking looked at me!
COBB
Yeah?
YOUNG MAN
Yeah! She fucking knows - we have
to leave!
Cobb places his spoon back into his dish and looks up at the
Young Man with an almost bored expression.
56.
COBB
(gesturing to the waiter)
We’ll leave - not that we have
anything to worry about other than
you making a twat of yourself.
EXT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Cobb and the Young Man exit. Cobb suddenly turns on the Young
Man as if he might hit him.
COBB
(pointing at the Young
Man’s face)
You know, I really hate it when I
don’t get to finish a good meal
with a coffee.
The Young Man looks flabbergasted.
YOUNG MAN
But -
COBB
(bitter)
Just don’t fucking say it!
He waves at a taxi.
INT. BACK OF TAXI - NIGHT
Cobb looks out of the window like a sullen child. The Young
Man looks at him, thinking.
YOUNG MAN
Look, she recognized me, OK? She’s
had a second look at me. It makes
me nervous.
Cobb turns to the Young Man.
COBB
(calm)
If you’re worried about being
recognized, why don’t you do
something about your appearance?
Haircut, smart clothes, your own
mother won’t recognize you.
The Young Man looks down at himself, chastened.
57.
COBB (CONT’D)
(grinning to himself)
Just because you break into
people’s homes, doesn’t mean you
have to look like a criminal.
FADE TO BLACK.
EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - NIGHT
The Young Man (short hair, clean-shaven) buzzes The Blonde.
THE BLONDE
(voice on tannoy)
Fuck off.
YOUNG MAN
How do you know it’s me? Could be
your mother you just told to fuck
off.
THE BLONDE
(voice on tannoy)
I mean it.
YOUNG MAN
Please, just let me in... I’ve come
to apologize.
The lock clicks open and he steps inside.
INT. THE BLONDE’S FLAT, HALLWAY - NIGHT
The Young Man walks slowly down the corridor. Passing the
bedroom he sees The Blonde Sitting on the bed. He stands in
the doorway.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Double bed, light, feminine, patterned fabrics and many
cushions, a chest of drawers.
The Blonde sits on the bed, legs crossed, smoking a
cigarette. The Young Man considers his opening line.
THE BLONDE
So apologize.
YOUNG MAN
I haven’t been entirely honest with
you.
58.
The Blonde raises her eyebrows.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
I’m writing about burglaries.
THE BLONDE
(confused)
What?
YOUNG MAN
I’m researching burglaries. I’m,
I’m doing a piece about a guy I
know who burgles people. That’s why
I’ve been asking you questions
about your burglary.
THE BLONDE
Why didn’t you just tell me.
YOUNG MAN
I didn’t want to upset you. See,
I’ve been breaking into houses with
him - that is, he’s been breaking
in and I’ve been watching him. I
mean, I haven’t taken anything
or... whatever, I just go along and
watch, for my research.
THE BLONDE
Is that it?
YOUNG MAN
Yes.
THE BLONDE
What does that have to do with
anything?
YOUNG MAN
Now I’ve been honest with you, I’d
like you to return the favor.
THE BLONDE
I have been honest with you.
YOUNG MAN
You’re still seeing the bald guy.
THE BLONDE
(flustered)
How do -
59.
YOUNG MAN
I was early the other day. I saw
him leave. You said it was over.
THE BLONDE
(resigned)
It is.
YOUNG MAN
(quizzical)
Then why?
THE BLONDE
He’s blackmailing me.
YOUNG MAN
You said he’s rich - why would...
THE BLONDE
(bitter)
Who said anything about money?
The Young Man sighs. He slides down the wall to sit in the
doorway, his back against the frame. After a moment’s thought
he looks up at The Blonde.
YOUNG MAN
What’s he blackmailing you with?
THE BLONDE
Photos.
YOUNG MAN
Of what?
THE BLONDE
Of me. And don’t ask me anything
else about them. You’d only want
the details to fuel your seedy
little fantasies. Let’s just say
that my mother wouldn’t frame them
for her sideboard.
YOUNG MAN
You’ve got me all wrong, you know.
THE BLONDE
Have I?
The Young Man nods. He thinks for a moment.
YOUNG MAN
So where does he keep them?
60.
THE BLONDE
In his office. Why?
YOUNG MAN
Maybe I can get them back.
THE BLONDE
How?
YOUNG MAN
Break in and take them. I can get
my friend to do it with me - there
must be valuable stuff in his
office, right?
THE BLONDE
He sometimes has money in his safe.
YOUNG MAN
(shaking his head)
No, we can’t get into a safe -
THE BLONDE
That’s where the pictures are.
YOUNG MAN
What?
THE BLONDE
In a manilla envelope in his safe,
negatives and eight-by-ten prints.
YOUNG MAN
Then we can’t -
THE BLONDE
I know the combination.
YOUNG MAN
How?
THE BLONDE
I’ve seen him open it a million
times. I’ve always figured that I
might get a chance to lift the
photos.
YOUNG MAN
Right, that’s what we’ll do then.
He gets up and moves on to the bed.
61.
THE BLONDE
Nobody in their right mind would
steal from him.
YOUNG MAN
(putting his arms around
her)
If we don’t get caught it won’t
make any difference who it was we
stole from - and we won’t get
caught.
He kisses The Blonde. She pulls away to speak.
THE BLONDE
Just promise me one thing. If you
get the pictures you’ll bring them
to me without looking at them,
without even opening the envelope.
YOUNG MAN
Of course.
THE BLONDE
I’ve got your word?
YOUNG MAN
You have my word.
They kiss again.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
The Young Man (short hair, bruised face) has taken his jacket
off and is frantically taping bundles of money to his arms
and around his waist. He works in a frenzy, ripping masking
tape with his teeth, grabbing bundles and slapping them
against his stomach. He covers his arms and abdomen, but
there’s still a lot more money, so he undoes his trousers,
pulls them off and frantically starts to tape bundles to his
bare legs. His jacket, the manilla envelope and his hammer
are sitting on the desk. He grabs a bundle and tapes it to
his ankle. He straightens up, looks at the remaining money.
YOUNG MAN
(whisper)
Fuck it.
He takes the tape and passes it around his midriff, securing
the bundles which he has already taped to his waist.
62.
As he is doing so the overhead light snaps on and the Young
Man freezes.
One of Baldy’s business companions is standing in the office
doorway, a look of amazement on his face. Neither man moves.
The Young Man eyes the hammer on the desk, within easy reach.
He grabs it as he launches himself at Baldy’s man, trailing
bank notes in the air behind him as he flies across the room,
hammer raised.
The Young Man brings the hammer down across the other man’s
head in a nasty sideswipe. The man goes down and doesn’t get
up. The Young Man moves back to the desk, shocked. He
clumsily puts his trousers on over the money, then looks over
at the man on the floor as he grabs for his suit jacket. The
man is not moving; there is blood on his head and on the
floor.
The Young Man gets his jacket on, tears his eyes away from
the prone man to realize that he has blood on his hands and
now on his previously white shirt. He shudders as he jams the
bloody hammer into his waistband, grabs the manilla envelope
and heads for the window. A last glance at the prone man
before climbing out of the window.
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
The Young Man practically falls out of the window and on to
the ground. He struggles to his feet, weaving like a drunk,
and heads away from the office window towards the main
street.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Small, cold, dingy.
The Young Man stands in front of the mirror, examining his
longish hair and attempt at a beard.
He picks up some nail scissors and starts to cut his hair.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Small, dark, cluttered.
The Young Man is knotting a tie in front of a dusty, cracked
mirror. He is wearing a dark suit, old-fashioned and wellworn.
His hair is dramatically shorter; a ragged near-crew
cut.
63.
He plays with his hair, looking at his reflection. He rubs
his newly shaven chin.
Close on the mirror we see that the strip of passport photos
of The Blonde are wedged into the bottom right-hand corner of
the frame.
The Young Man’s eye is caught by the photos and he picks them
up, looking closely at them, a thoughtful expression on his
face.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Lighter. Neater, apart from the paper-covered desk.
The Young Man is on the phone, waiting for it to be picked up
at the other end. We hear the click as it is answered.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Yeah?
YOUNG MAN
Cobb? Bill.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hello, ‘Bill’.
CUT TO:
INT. INDISTINCT SURROUNDINGS; A WINDOW COVERED BY A NET
CURTAIN - DAY
Cobb is standing by the windows on the phone. He wears a
white shirt, unbuttoned.
COBB
What can I do for you?
YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
Nothing too important.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
YOUNG MAN
It’s about the stuff.
64.
COBB (O.S.)
What about it?
The Young Man’s other hand comes into frame; he is holding
the passport photos as well as some bunched-up silk.
YOUNG MAN
(staring at the photos)
I’ve met a guy - I won’t go into
details. I’ll take care of it
myself as you suggested, and you’ll
get half. I can’t promise to get as
much as you would but I’d like to
give it a go. How does that sound?
COBB (O.S.)
Sounds fine. Anything else?
YOUNG MAN
I took your advice.
COBB (O.S.)
What advice?
YOUNG MAN
My appearance. I cut my hair, and
I’m all dressed up.
COBB (O.S.)
‘With no place to go.’
CUT TO:
INT. BY THE WINDOW - DAY
COBB
You know I wasn’t being entirely
serious about that.
YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
It makes me feel better.
COBB
Safer, huh?
YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
Safer. I’ll give you a call when
I’ve got the money.
COBB
Right.
65.
He hangs up. We go wider and see that he is leaning on the
windowsill in what appears to be a bedroom. His shirt is
completely untucked and unbuttoned.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
What was all that about?
COBB
You.
Cobb’s POV shows us The Blonde, lying in bed, under the
sheets, but apparently naked.
COBB (CONT’D)
Your stuff, anyway.
He clambers up on to the bed to lean against the wall beside
The Blonde.
COBB (CONT’D)
He’s going to deal with it himself.
The Blonde lays her arm across Cobb’s stomach and looks up at
him.
THE BLONDE
Meaning?
COBB
Meaning he took the bait and he’s
hooked. He’s going to hang on to
your stuff, pretend to sell it,
give me some money. If you’re lucky
he might even give you most of it
back. It’s perfect, the photos
worked. I’ve even got him to cut
his hair and change his clothes.
THE BLONDE
So are you going to tell me where
you hid my earring, now?
COBB
(grinning)
No. And I wouldn’t hold your breath
for the return of your underwear,
either. He’ll be far too
embarrassed to admit to stealing
your panties.
THE BLONDE
Shit. And did you have to pretend
to break down my door?
66.
(MORE)
Couldn’t you have pretended to find
the spare key?
COBB
(laughing)
Couldn’t. That would have been
three spare keys in a row - even
‘Bill’ isn’t going to buy that.
When went to his place it was
embarrassing - right under the mat,
just like I told him... pathetic.
It was a new mat as well, and I
swear, I seriously think he went
out and bought the mat just so he
could put his key under it.
The Blonde laughs. Cobb laughs.
FADE TO:
INT. YOUNG MAN’S BEDROOM - DAY
The Young Man is knotting his tie in front of the mirror.
The Blonde is lying on the bed behind him.
THE BLONDE
What if he won’t help?
YOUNG MAN
Then I’ll do it on my own.
THE BLONDE
How long will you be?
YOUNG MAN
Couple of hours.
EXT. CHARING CROSS STATION LEFT-LUGGAGE OFFICE - DAY
The Young Man hands over his ticket and collects the leather
holdall.
EXT. HUNGERFORD BRIDGE - DAY
The Young Man crosses south, carrying the leather holdall.
INT. HALLWAY IN A BLOCK OF FLATS - DAY
The Young Man knocks on a door.
67.
THE BLONDE (CONT'D)
The door is opened by Cobb.
COBB
You’re late.
(noticing the holdall)
You said you’d fenced it.
He steps back to let the Young Man in.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Comfortable, tastefully furnished.
Cobb is sitting on the couch. The Young Man stands at the
window.
COBB
It’ll take me a few days to sell
all of it.
YOUNG MAN
Whatever.
COBB
Something else on your mind?
The Young Man turns to face Cobb.
YOUNG MAN
I want to break into a place.
COBB
I’ve been scouting a couple -
YOUNG MAN
A particular place. For some
photos.
COBB
Photos?
YOUNG MAN
Photos. For a friend.
COBB
What’s the place?
YOUNG MAN
Office. In a safe, but we’ll have
the combination.
68.
COBB
If it’s for a friend, where’s the
money in it?
YOUNG MAN
There’s money in the safe...
probably.
COBB
Probably? Whose office?
YOUNG MAN
Club-owner, pornographer type.
COBB
Heavy?
YOUNG MAN
From the sound of it.
Cobb exhales. He stares hard at the Young Man.
COBB
What the fuck’s going on?
YOUNG MAN
I’m seeing someone. They need my
help.
Cobb stands up and walks over to the Young Man.
COBB
Who are you seeing?
The Young Man looks away.
COBB (CONT’D)
(loud)
Who?! Who are you seeing?!
The Young Man looks into Cobb’s eyes.
YOUNG MAN
The owner of the bag.
COBB
(confused)
What?
YOUNG MAN
The woman who owns the flat we hit -
the one with the pictures of
herself.
69.
COBB
(barely concealing rage)
Tell me you’re fucking joking.
YOUNG MAN
(excited)
Her pictures - I was curious, I
followed her, got to know her.
She’... she’s... she’s... we’re in
love.
COBB
You’ve slept with her?
YOUNG MAN
(unaware of Cobb’s growing
rage)
Yeah. She’s fantastic, amazing.
That’s why I haven’t sold her
stuff, I mean, I thought that I
might give it back to her but that
would mean -
COBB
That would mean telling her that it
was you who fucking robbed her! How
shrew - How, how, how, prudent of
you not to tell her that!
The Young Man is quiet, realizing he has misjudged the
situation.
COBB (CONT’D)
Nice hair, by the way. And a nice
suit, shame about the bloodstains,
though.
YOUNG MAN
(looks down at himself)
Bloodstains?
Cobb punches him in the face then belts him in the stomach.
The Young Man doubles over, groaning.
COBB
I fucking warned you.
He smiles as he brings his elbows down hard into the Young
Man’s back. The Young Man grunts and staggers to the side,
just keeping on his feet. Cobb pushes him back across the
room and charges at him.
COBB (CONT’D)
I won’t let anyone put me at risk.
70.
As he speaks, Cobb grabs the Young Man’s face with one hand
and punches him hard in the face several times.
The Young Man slips to the floor, dragging Cobb down with
him. The two men scrabble around on the floor, the Young Man
putting up a right until Cobb finally swivels round and boots
him in the ribs, then the face.
The Young Man groans and bleeds as Cobb staggers to his feet,
out of breath. Cobb dusts himself down and does his hair in
the mirror.
COBB (CONT’D)
(at his reflection)
Idiot. How could you be so stupid?
(turns to look at the
Young Man)
You’re on your own, Billy-boy.
Here...
(reaches into his pocket
and pulls out a pair of
rubber gloves; he tosses
them at the Young Man)
... take these. Present from you.
To get you started on your new solo
career.
He reaches down and pulls the Young Man to his feet. The
Young Man’s face is a bloody mess. Cobb picks up the rubber
gloves and stuffs them into the Young Man’s breast pocket.
He drags the Young Man to the door.
COBB (CONT’D)
Now, fuck off.
He throws the Young Man out of the door and slams it behind
him. He laughs hysterically as he walks back into the living
room and we:
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. COBB’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Cobb is lying on the floor, tossing a golfball into the air
and catching it just before it hits his face.
The Blonde is sitting on the couch.
THE BLONDE
Did you have to beat him?
71.
COBB
Did you have to sleep with him?
THE BLONDE
You told me to.
COBB
I said you should if you had to,
that’s not the same as telling you
to.
(catches the ball and
looks over)
Did you enjoy it?
THE BLONDE
Did you enjoy beating him up?
COBB
Of course.
The Blonde shakes her head pityingly.
COBB (CONT’D)
He brought it on himself. He didn’t
have to tell me he was seeing you,
but once he did I had to react the
way I would really.
He sits up.
COBB (CONT’D)
I’m in deep shit, this has to work.
THE BLONDE
But why are you so sure they think
you were involved?
COBB
They’ve already had me in for
questioning, for Christ’s sake.
They know my m.o. And it’s just a
matter of time before they find the
bloke who saw me leave and pull me
in.
THE BLONDE
You think he got a good look at
you?
72.
COBB
No, which is why this will work;
all we need is someone else with
the same way of working and roughly
the same appearance caught in the
act.
THE BLONDE
Why can’t you just tell them what
really happened - that you just
found her like that?
COBB
If you’d seen her, you wouldn’t
even ask. It was horrible, blood
everywhere. Her face had been...
beaten... almost not human. I’d
been in the flat a while, I may
have left traces, forensic stuff, I
don’t know. But she was fresh, she
hadn’t been dead long, the witness
might put me there close enough to
the time of death -
THE BLONDE
But if he didn’t get the a good
look -
COBB
That’s not the point! A crime that
brutal, an old lady beaten like
that... if they think it’s me,
they’ll find a way to make it
stick. There has to be someone else
- I’ve told them there’s someone
else!
THE BLONDE
What if he has an alibi?
COBB
He’s a loner, that’s why he’s so
perfect. And he looks so different
now that strangers aren’t going to
remember having seen him. He’s our
man.
The Blonde and Cobb look at each other.
FADE TO BLACK.
73.
EXT. NARROW PASSAGEWAY CONNECTING TWO STREETS LIT BY A
STREETLIGHT - NIGHT
It is raining.
The Young Man (short shair, shades) stumbles along. His dark
suit bulges oddly. He brings his hand up to adjust his shades
and we see a fifty-pound note sticking out of his cuff.
He disappears around the corner and we:
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The Young Man has taken his suit off and is removing the
money from his body. He is wet, his tie is loose, there is
blood on his shirt, he is on the phone.
YOUNG MAN
(strained, on edge)
I got it.
THE BLONDE (O.S.)
You’re bringing them to me?
YOUNG MAN
(bending to remove money
from his leg)
I had to stop off to dump the
money.
THE BLONDE (O.S.)
Money?
YOUNG MAN
(giggling)
Lot of fucking money!
He yelps as he yanks tape from his hairy legs.
THE BLONDE (O.S.)
What?
YOUNG MAN
Nothing. I’ll be over soon.
THE BLONDE (O.S.)
So it was OK?
YOUNG MAN
(a pause, close to tears)
OK, yeah. I’ll be over soon.
74.
He hangs up the phone. He’s removed most of the money, but
odd bundles hang from his legs and shirt.
He looks at the hammer lying on the floor, blood on it. Next
to the hammer lies the manilla envelope.
The Young Man picks up the envelope, pauses for a moment,
then rips it open and yanks out the contents: eight-by-ten
glossies.
The photos are straight modelling portrait shots of The
Blonde - absolutely nothing interesting or remarkable about
them whatsoever.
He flips through them again and again looking for some
meaning, some super-subtle obscenity he might be missing, a
manic desperate look developing on his face.
He flings them across the room, and we:
CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BLONDE’S FLAT
The Young Man looks up at the window. He’s not happy.
INT. THE BLONDE’S FRONT HALL - NIGHT
The Blonde moves to answer the door.
The door opens to reveal a wet, bedraggled Young Man, bruises
on his face. The Young Man slaps The Blonde hard and walks in
past her. She expresses neither pain nor surprise.
THE BLONDE
You promised me you wouldn’t look
in the envelope.
YOUNG MAN
Wasn’t sealed, they fell out.
The Blonde stairs at him with a half-smile.
THE BLONDE
Right... They fell out.
The Young Man looks back at her coldly.
YOUNG MAN
Are you going to explain?
The Blonde says nothing.
75.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
(rising anger)
What?! Was it all bullshit just to
get the money?
THE BLONDE
(shrugs)
He’s never had any in there before.
The Young Man grabs her by the shoulders and shakes her.
YOUNG MAN
What, then?!!
The Blonde puts her hands up defensively to tell him to
remove his hands. He does so.
THE BLONDE
(matter-of-factly)
For a friend. The police think he
did something which he didn’t and
he needs a decoy - another likely
suspect, someone caught robbing a
place the same way he does, using
his methods.
YOUNG MAN
His methods?
(truth dawning)
Who’s the friend?
THE BLONDE
(mischievous, waiting for
a reaction)
Cobb.
The Young Man closes his eyes.
The Blonde turns away.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D)
(straight)
He broke into a flat a couple of
weeks ago. Found an old lady who’d
been beaten to death. He ran off,
somebody saw him and a few days
later the police picked him up for
questioning. They think he killed
her -
YOUNG MAN
(opens eyes)
He probably did.
76.
THE BLONDE
He’s a thief, Not a murderer. He
told them they had the wrong man,
had him confused with another
burglar he knew about, one who has
the same m.o....you.
YOUNG MAN
Why me?
THE BLONDE
(like it’s his own fault)
You set yourself up for it. Cobb
noticed you following him days
before he approached you - at first
the thought you were the police but
then he followed you -
YOUNG MAN
He followed me?
THE BLONDE
(sarcastic)
He followed you and realized that
you were just some... weirdo...
waiting to be drawn into it, used.
YOUNG MAN
(asking for it)
So you and Cobb...
The Blonde shrugs and smiles.
The Young Man slaps the wall hard by the side of The Blonde’s
head. She doesn’t flinch. He turns around, raising his hands
in total frustration.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
How could you do this to me? To
anyone?
THE BLONDE
It’s not that bad. You’ve got the
money. You didn’t kill the old
woman. You’re just there to plant
doubt in the minds of the police -
they’ll never charge you. The idea
was that someone would catch you
breaking in tonight, the police
would pull you in, then ask you
about the old lady - which you
wouldn’t know anything about.
77.
YOUNG MAN
(incredulous)
Yeah, but they’d still charge me
with breaking and entering!
THE BLONDE
(amused)
But you did do that. And anyway,
for whatever reason, nobody did
catch you red-handed.
YOUNG MAN
(wielding the bloody
hammer)
He came in, he went down. I didn’t
hang around to see if he got up.
It’s his blood on my hammer.
(smashes hammer into wall)
How could you do this to me?
THE BLONDE
(unimpressed)
It’s not personal. When I agreed to
it, I didn’t even known you.
The Young Man drops the hammer. The Blonde opens her eyes.
The Young Man takes a deep breath, regains his composure.
YOUNG MAN
I’m going to the police in the
morning.
THE BLONDE
You can’t.
YOUNG MAN
I’m going and I’ll tell them
everything.
THE BLONDE
You can’t - they’ll never believe
you.
YOUNG MAN
I’ll tell them everything and
they’ll believe me because it’s the
truth.
THE BLONDE
They’ll never believe you unless
someone backs you up.
YOUNG MAN
You could.
78.
THE BLONDE
I won’t.
YOUNG MAN
(confident)
They’ll make you. Your lies won’t
hold up against the truth.
The Blonde turns away, shaking her head.
THE BLONDE
You know, I really wouldn’t do -
She is cut off by the sound of the door slamming. She turns
to see that the Young Man is gone.
FADE TO BLACK.
INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY
Close on the Young Man (short hair, bruises)
YOUNG MAN
That’s it.
Wider shows us a room lit by early morning sun, the Young Man
seated at a table, an Older Man opposite. Between them on the
table is a tape recorder. They both look tired. The Older Man
doesn’t speak.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
I mean.. If you’ve got questions..
The Older Man leans forward.
OLDER MAN
One or two.
A pause. The Young Man raises his eyebrows in expectation.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET IN THE WEST END - DAY
Cobb strolls down the street. He is carrying the leather
holdall.
CUT TO:
79.
INT. ROOM WITH TABLE AND TAPE RECORDER - DAY
OLDER MAN
You see... We don’t actually have
any unsolved murders of old ladies
right now.
YOUNG MAN
(baffled)
But there has -
OLDER MAN
(more assertive)
There is no such ongoing
investigation.
The Young Man looks confused and scared.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
And we don’t know this...
(looks at his notes)
... ‘Cobb’ of yours.
CUT TO:
INT. THE BLONDE’S FRONT HALL - DAY
The Blonde opens the front door to Cobb and we:
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Blonde and Cobb are having a drink.
COBB
I warned you he’d look in the
envelope.
THE BLONDE
He gave me his word. I believed
him.
COBB
Nothing personal, he couldn’t help
himself - he’s a born peeper.
Anyway, down to business.
THE BLONDE
Business?
80.
Cobb takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and starts to
wipe the outside of his glass and we:
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY
We move in on the Young Man, puzzled, thinking hard.
OLDER MAN (O.S.)
Perhaps there’s something else
you’d like to tell me about.
CUT TO:
INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Blonde watches, puzzled as Cobb stretches his rubber
gloves and puts them on, interlacing his fingers for a snug
fit.
COBB
Where’s the hammer?
THE BLONDE
Oh, down there in the bag.
She points to a shopping bag on the table across from Cobb.
Cobb rises, crosses the room and picks up the bag with his
back to The Blonde. She can’t see him take it out of the bag
and look at the dried blood on its head.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D)
What are you going to do with it?
COBB
(his back to her)
The old man was pretty specific
about the way I should do things.
THE BLONDE
(puzzled)
What’s he have to say about it?
COBB
(turning around, hammer in
hand)
Well, he is giving me all the money
out of his safe.
81.
THE BLONDE
(not liking this)
Money? What for?
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY
Close on the Young Man as he thinks.
The Older Man puts on a pair of rubber surgical gloves.
OLDER MAN (O.S.)
Anything at all. Your side of
things?
CUT TO:
INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Cobb moves towards The Blonde with the hammer.
COBB
(smiling)
He says your demands have become
unreasonable... too greedy in your
blackmail.
THE BLONDE
(scared now)
But, no - I, I, I don’t -
COBB
(smiling, soothing)
Something about an incident you
witnessed in this very room? He was
specific about where and how I
should take care of things. Some
sense of poetic justice, I suppose.
THE BLONDE
But I -
COBB
Something about a bloodstained
carpet you’ve got stashed away to
back up your story, should it ever
be told.
The Blonde is crying.
82.
THE BLONDE
How could you do this to me?
COBB
(softly)
Money.
He lunges for The Blonde, grabbing her wrist and pulling her
to the floor. He forces her hand flat against the floor and
raises the hammer high above his had and we:
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY
Close on the Young Man as he realizes something.
YOUNG MAN
Did you talk to her?
OLDER MAN
(nods gravely)
We found her early this morning.
YOUNG MAN
Found her?
OLDER MAN
Her body.
The Young Man covers his face with his hands.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
We also found a hammer with two
types of blood on it, one type
which I assume will match the block
you put in the hospital. All of her
fingers were smashed - you must
have tortured her for the
combination.
YOUNG MAN
NO! I haven’t done anything to her!
Go and pick up Cobb, he did it, he
must have done it -
The Older man silences the Young Man by putting a shoebox on
the table between them.
OLDER MAN
(rifling through the
contents of the box)
83.
(MORE)
We found some interesting items at
your flat. In addition to the
various items which the deceased
reported stolen last week, we found
several pairs of ladies’ underwear -
are they hers?
The Young Man says nothing.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
I assume so, since they were found
stashed with some passport-style
photographs of the deceased.
The Young Man closes his eyes.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
(pulls a small, clear
plastic bag from the box)
We also found this pearl earring.
The Young Man opens his eyes. He looks at the evidence bag
which the Older Man is holding out for him to see. Inside it
is The Blonde’s pearl earring.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
It matches the one worn by the
deceased at the time of her death.
Little trophy?
YOUNG MAN
(desperation)
NO! Cobb planted it! He took it
when we broke in - pick him up, I
gave you his address, he’s the one
who killed her - he has to be.
OLDER MAN
We went to the address you gave us.
There’s no ‘Cobb’ there. The flat
belongs to a...
(checks notes)
... Timothy Kerr. He just got back
from holiday and he says that he
was robbed while he was away. Not
too much was taken... but his new
credit card hasn’t arrived -
YOUNG MAN
That was Cobb, see?! We used it to
buy a meal one time!
The Older Man reaches into the box and pulls out another
clear evidence bag. Inside it is as credit card.
84.
OLDER MAN (CONT'D)
OLDER MAN
We found this at your flat.
YOUNG MAN
(running out of steam)
It was... Cobb who stole it...
The Older Man flips the card over to display the signature on
the back.
OLDER MAN
Is this your handwriting?
The Young Man looks at the card in despair.
YOUNG MAN
(quiet)
Yes.
CUT TO:
EXT. BUSY WEST END STREET CROWDED WITH PEDESTRIANS - DAY
Cobb comes out of a café and walks away from us down the
street.
He stops and looks back towards us over his shoulder as if to
check that no one is following him.
Satisfied, he turns back, moves off and is swallowed by the
mass of pedestrians, crossing the frame in slo-mo and we:
FADE TO BLACK.

Batman created by
Bob Kane
T H E D A R K K N I G H T
BURNING. Massive flames. A dark shape emerges- The BAT
SYMBOL. Growing. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.
CUT TO:
DAYLIGHT. Moving over the towers of downtown Gotham...
Closing in on an office building... On a large window...
Which SHATTERS to reveal-
INT. OFFICE, HIGH RISE -- DAY
A man in a CLOWN MASK holding a SMOKING SILENCED PISTOL
ejects a shell casing. This is DOPEY. He turns to a second
man, HAPPY, also in clown mask, who steps forward with a
CABLE LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the street and
FIRES a cable across. Dopey secures the line to an I-beam
line- CLAMP on- sends a KIT BAG out then steps OUT the
window...
EXT. HIGH-RISE -- DAY
...into space. The men SLIDE across the DIZZYING DROP...
landing on the lower roof across the street.
EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY
A MAN on the corner, back to us, holding a CLOWN MASK. An
SUV pulls up. The man gets in, puts on his mask. Inside the
car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS.
GRUMPY
Three of a kind. Let's do this.
One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic weapon.
CHUCKLES
That's it? Three guys?
GRUMPY
There's two on the roof. Every guy
is an extra share. Five shares is
plenty.
CHUCKLES
Six shares. Don't forget the guy who
planned the job.
GRUMPY
Yeah? He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice then I get why
they call him the Joker.
Grumpy cocks his weapon. Bozo pulls the car over in front of
the GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL BANK.
EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK -- CONTINUOUS
Dopey PRIES open an access panel-
HAPPY
Why do they call him the Joker?
DOPEY
I heard he wears make-up.
HAPPY
Make-up?
Dopey pulls out thick bundles of blue CAT 5 cables.
DOPEY
Yeah. To scare people. War paint.
EXT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS
Grumpy, Chuckles and Bozo get out of the car and march into
the bank CARRYING ASSAULT RIFLESINT.
BANK -- DAY
The Security Guard looks up- Grumpy FIRES into the ceiling.
Customers SCREAM. Chuckles CRACKS the Security Guard.
As Grumpy and Bozo round up the hostages, one of the TELLERS
presses a button mounted beneath her window- a SILENT ALARM.
EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY
Dopey watches the alarm PING his handheld.
DOPEY
Here comes the silent alarm.
(touches a button)
And there it goes. That's funny. It
didn't dial out to 911- it was
trying to reach a private number.
Behind him, Happy RAISES his silenced HANDGUN.
HAPPY
Is it a problem?
DOPEY
No, no. I'm done here.
Happy SHOOTS. Dopey SLUMPS. Happy picks up his bag and
FORCES OPEN the roof access door...
INT. STAIRWELL, BANK -- DAY
...and speeds down the stairs, to the basement. He SLAMS
open the door...
2.
INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY
...and comes face to face with a huge VAULT.
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Bozo and Grumpy move down the line of hostages- Bozo hands
each Hostage OBJECTS from a bag. A GRENADE. Grumpy follows,
PULLING THE PINS.
GRUMPY
Obviously, we don't want you doing
anything with your hands other than
holding on for dear life.
BLAM. Chuckles is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET- Grumpy and Bozo DIVE
for cover- the Bank Manager steps out of his office, SHOTGUN
in hand. Hostages SCRAMBLE, CLINGING their grenades...
INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY
Happy CLAMPS a DRILL to the vault- the bit SPINS- SLIDES into
the metal door- a BOLT of ELECTRICITY RIPS THROUGH THE DRILL,
THROWING HAPPY TO THE FLOORINT.
LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Grumpy and Bozo cower as the Bank Manager FIRES again.
GRUMPY
He's got three left?
Bozo raises TWO fingers. Grumpy squeezes off a SHOT. The
Bank Manager FIRES. FIRES again. Grumpy looks at Bozo, who
nods. Grumpy JUMPS UP.
The Bank Manager FIRES- Grumpy GRUNTS as buckshot CLIPS his
shoulder. FALLS. The Bank Manager moves in for the kill,
FUMBLING for new shells. Bozo STANDS- SHOOTS him.
Bozo picks up the shotgun. Grumpy checks his wound- it's
superficial. He struggles to his feet.
GRUMPY
Where'd you learn to count?!
Bozo's mask stares him down. Grumpy heads for the stairs in
the back. Bozo starts loading fresh shells into the shotgun.
BANK MANAGER
You have any idea who you're stealing
from? You and your friends are dead.
Bozo looks down at him. Says nothing.
3.
INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY
Happy at the vault door, barefoot, turning the tumblers with
hands stuffed into his SNEAKERS. Grumpy walks in.
HAPPY
They wired this thing up with 5,000
volts. What kind of bank does that?
GRUMPY
A mob bank. Guess the Joker's as
crazy as they say.
Happy shrugs. Grips the WHEEL BOLT and SPINS it.
GRUMPY
Where's the alarm guy?
HAPPY
Boss told me when the guy was done I
should take him out. One less share.
GRUMPY
Funny, he told me something
similar...
Happy FREEZES. The wheel SPINS to a STOP- the vault DOOR
CLUNKS OPEN- Happy GRABS for his weapon- SPINS to see Grumpy
SHOOT. Grumpy steps over Happy into the vault...
INT. VAULT, BANK -- DAY
...which is filled with an eight-foot MOUNTAIN OF CASH.
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Grumpy walks into the lobby, straining under several DUFFELS
filled with cash. He DUMPS them. Looks at Bozo. LAUGHS.
GRUMPY
C'mon, there's a lot to carry...
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Bozo walks back into the lobby with two more DUFFELS. Sets
them down on an ENORMOUS PILE. Grumpy looks at it.
GRUMPY
If this guy was so smart he would
have had us bring a bigger car.
Grumpy JABS his pistol in Bozo's back. Takes his weapon.
GRUMPY
I'm betting the Joker told you to
kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
4.
BOZO
(shakes head)
No. I kill the bus driver.
GRUMPY
Bus driver? What bus-
Bozo steps backwards. SMASH. Hostages SCREAM as the TAIL
END OF A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS ROCKETS through the front of the
bank, SLAMMING Grumpy into the teller's window.
Bozo picks up Grumpy's weapon. Another clown OPENS the rear
door of the bus. Bozo SHOOTS him. Then loads the bags onto
the bus. The wounded Bank Manager watches him. In the
distance: SIRENS.
BANK MANAGER
Think you're smart, huh? Well, the
guy who hired you's just do the same
to you...
Bozo slowly shakes his head.
BANK MANAGER
Sure he will. Criminals in this town
used to believe in things...
Bozo turns back to the Bank Manager. Crouches over him.
BANK MANAGER
Honor. Respect. What do you
believe, huh? What do you bel-
Joker slides a GRENADE into the man's mouth. A PURPLE THREAD
is knotted around the pin.
THE JOKER
I believe that what doesn't kill
you...
Bozo PULLS off his MASK. The Bank Manager GASPS. In the
reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we
see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP. THE JOKER.
THE JOKER
...simply makes you stranger.
The Bank Manager's eyes go wide. The Joker rises, strolls
towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade
pin UNRAVELLING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he
walks. The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door,
TRAPPING THE PURPLE THREAD...
EXT. SCHOOL, GOTHAM -- DAY
Kids pour out, heading onto a long line of school buses.
5.
INT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS
As the bus pulls out, the purple thread PULLS THE PINhostages
scream and scurry away from the Bank Manager, who
shakes with fear as, with a FIZZ, the grenade does not
explode, but SPEWS RED SMOKE.
EXT. BANK -- DAY
The School Bus pulls free of the Bank wall and pulls out onto
the street, SLIDING INTO THE LINE OF IDENTICAL BUSES HEADING
PAST THE BANK. The buses trundle past COP CARS racing up the
street... and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. MOVING OVER GOTHAM -- NIGHT
From the top of a brick building a SHAFT OF LIGHT comes on.
EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- CONTINUOUS
A PATROLMAN looks up at the BAT-SIGNAL. Smiles. A DEALER
standing beside a car spots the signal. Steps back.
DEALER
No, man. I don't like it tonight.
BUYER
What're you, superstitious? You got
more chance of winning the powerball
than running into him...
INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
DETECTIVE RAMIREZ, female, rookie detective, 30's, makes
coffee, watching a news show on the television.
ON SCREEN: The host, MIKE ENGEL, lays into the MAYOR.
ENGEL
Mr Mayor, you were elected on a
campaign to clean up the city... when
are you going to start?
MAYOR
Well, Mike-
ENGEL
Like this so-called Batman- a lot of
people say he's doing some good
that criminals are running scared...
but I say NO. What kind of hero
needs to wear a mask? You don't let
vigilantes run around breaking the
law... where does it end?
6.
(MORE)
Yet, we hear rumors that instead of
trying to arrest him the cops are
using him to do their dirty work.
MAYOR
I'm told our men in the Major Crimes
Unit are close to an arrest.
RAMIREZ
Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're
closing in on the Batman.
WUERTZ looks up, listless. Crumples up a paper.
WUERTZ
The investigation is ongoing.
He throws the paper at the trash. It rebounds off a board
headed 'BATMAN: SUSPECTS.' Lined with pictures: Abraham
Lincoln. Elvis. The Abominable Snowman.
EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT -- NIGHT
Ramirez comes out onto the roof. LIEUTENANT GORDON sits by a
SEARCHLIGHT. She hands Gordon a cup of coffee.
RAMIREZ
Ever intending to see your wife
again, Lieutenant?
GORDON
I thought you had to go look after
your mother, detective.
RAMIREZ
They checked her back into hospital.
GORDON
I'm sorry.
RAMIREZ
(making light)
Least there she's got someone round
the clock. Unlike your wife.
(looks at bat-signal)
He hasn't shown?
Gordon gets up. Looks into the sky at the bat-signal.
GORDON
Often doesn't. But I like reminding
everybody that he's out there.
RAMIREZ
Why wouldn't he come?
GORDON
Hopefully... Because he's busy.
7.
ENGEL (cont'd)
EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT
Two black SUV's pull onto the top floor. A large man emergesthe
CHECHEN. A BODYGUARD points at the sky. The Chechen
peers up at the BAT-SIGNAL. Shrugs.
CHECHEN
That's why we bring dogs.
BODYGUARD 2 opens the back door- three enormous ROTWEILERS
emerge, GROWLING. The Chechen crouches, KISSING the dogs.
CHECHEN
My little princes...
(to bodyguards)
The Batman's invisible to you
fools... but my little princes...
they can find human meat in complete
darkness.
The Chechen moves to the second SUV, reaches in and DRAGS out
a skinny, wild-eyed JUNKIE by his hair.
JUNKIE
(babbling)
No! No get 'em off me! Off me!
The Chechen drags the Junkie towards a battered white van.
The van's REAR DOORS OPEN... two armed THUGS emerge, carrying
BARRELS... a third hovers in the dark interior.
CHECHEN
Look! Look what your drugs did to my
customers!
VOICE (O.S.)
Buyer beware...
The figure emerges: SCARECROW. Wearing his mask.
SCARECROW
I told your man my compound would
take you places. I never said they'd
be places you wanted to go.
CHECHEN
My business is repeat customers.
SCARECROW
If you don't like what I have to
offer, buy from someone else.
Assuming Batman left anyone else to
buy from.
The Chechen frowns. THE DOGS START BARKING.
8.
BODYGUARD
(nervous)
He's here.
A BURLY THUG at the periphery is suddenly SUCKED into the
darkness. In his place a shadow straightens, revealing
POINTED BAT-EARS against the glittering skyline.
CHECHEN
Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are
hungry, pity there's only one of
you...
A BODYGUARD to the side DISAPPEARS with a scream, and a
SECOND BAT-SHADOW appears.
The Chechen looks taken aback. Three more BAT-SHADOWS
appear... even the dogs stop growling.
BOOM! A hole appears in the SUV next to the Chechen. The
first bat-shadow steps into the light carrying a SHOTGUN.
CHAOS as men scatter and the rooftop erupts in GUNFIRE. The
Chechen TURNS as he hears one of his men SCREAM.
CHECHEN (CONT’D)
Loose the dogs!
A Bodyguard releases the DOGS- they RACE, SALIVATING, into
the darkness...
The Dogs RACE towards a Bat-Shadow- the first dog LEAPS, gets
its JAWS around the Bat-Shadow's throat...
Scarecrow ducks behind the van- holes PUNCHED in the side by
shotgun blasts right behind him. He starts to climb into the
driver's seat-
The muzzle of a shotgun is pressed to the back of his head- a
bat-shadow is behind him- he SPRAYS him with FEAR TOXIN- the
bat-shadow collapses to the ground, SCREAMING. The Cechnyan,
cowering from gunfire, looks down at him.
SCARECROW
Not the real thing.
CHECHEN
How you know?
SCARECROW
We're old friends.
A HUGE BLACK SHAPE SLAMS down onto a row of parked cars. The
BATMOBILE.
SCARECROW
That's more like it.
9.
The Chechen's men BLAST away at the front of the car: the
bullets SPARK off its monstrous surface harmlessly...
INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS
The cockpit is EMPTY. One of the screens reads "LOITER".
The shooting STOPS. The screen switches to "INTIMIDATE"
EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The men STARE at the Batmobile for a quiet moment... BOOM!
The Batmobile CANNONS blast cars all around the men-
A bat-shadow lines up his shotgun on a running bodyguard-
CLUNK- a BLACK GAUNTLET grasps the barrel and BENDS it
upwards with a HOWL of tortured steel- the bat-shadow looks
into the face of the Batman. The REAL BATMAN.
The Bat-shadow STUMBLES BACKWARDS in terror, leaving the bent
shotgun in Batman's hand. Batman OPENS his hand, revealing a
PNEUMATIC MANGLE hidden in his palm-
Batman bears down on the dogs mauling another bat-shadow-
DRAWS his GRAPPLING GUN and SHOOTS his grapple into the fake
Batman's leg and RIPS him from the dogs, one dog HANGING ON
as Batman pulls the unconscious man away... the Chechen RUNS
down the ramp towards the exit...
As Batman KICKS the dog off the fake Batman- the Chechen gets
into his SUV- another dog LOCKS ITS JAWS around Batman's
forearm, RIPPING, TEARING- Batman SWINGS THE DOG OVER HIS
HEAD- SMASHES it against the ground- its jaws OPEN...
Batman rises, an engine RACES behind him- he can't turn in
time- BLAM- he's SLAMMED sideways by the speeding van.
INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Scarecrow, driving, NODS at him and hits the gas... Batman
raises his hand, revealing his jointed mangle and pistons.
The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife
edge of his opened hand...
Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand
out and CHOPS again- the mangle gets STUCK- Scarecrow steers
towards a column...
EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Batman can't free himself- he turns a dial on his forearm
piston- EXPLOSIVE BOLTS blow, freeing his gauntlet from the
mangle- he ROLLS free of the van as it SCRAPES the column and
barrels down the circular exit ramp.
Batman rises. A phony batman lying on the ground watches as
Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp
and stands there, waiting for something.
10.
After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...
He's about to hit the exit ramp- the van appears- his cape
POPS OPEN- he SLAMS into the roof, CRUSHING the cab.
EXT. ROOFTOP, PARKING GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER
The Chechen's men are lined up against the wall, bound with
zip-ties. So are the fake batmen. Batman DUMPS Scarecrow
next to the three "Batmen", RIPS his mask off.
"BATMAN"
We're trying to help you!
BATMAN
I don't need help.
SCARECROW
Not my diagnosis.
Batman silences Scarecrow with his boot. Turns to "Batman"
BATMAN
Don't let me find you out here again.
Batman moves towards the Batmobile.
"BATMAN"
You need us! There's only one of youit's
war out here!
Batman gets into the Batmobile.
"BATMAN"
What gives you the right?! What's
the difference between you and me?!
As the Canopy hisses shut-
BATMAN
I'm not wearing hockey pads.
The "Batman" looks down at his makeshift costume as the
Batmobile ROARS past.
EXT. BANK -- NIGHT
LIEUTENANT GORDON ducks the barrage of SHOUTED QUESTIONS from
press and picks his way into the lobby of the bank.
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- NIGHT
FORENSIC SPECIALISTS work the room. Ramirez hands Gordon
PRINTS- indicates the surveillance cameras.
RAMIREZ
He can't resist showing us his face.
11.
Gordon looks at the grainy blow-up of THE JOKER'S FACE:
sweating clown makeup plastered thick around the mouth.
GORDON
Put this out, by morning we can put a
big top over central holding and
sell tickets. What's he hiding under
that makeup?
Gordon approaches a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER shooting Grumpy's
body. Gordon crouches to look at his clown mask. Batman
steps from the shadows. Gordon nods at Ramirez.
RAMIREZ
Give us a minute, please, people!
The Forensic team and Ramirez leave. Gordon hands Batman the
blow-up of the Joker.
BATMAN
Him again. Who are the others?
GORDON
Another bunch of small timers.
Batman pulls a DEVICE from his belt- moves to the bundles of
cash scattered near the clown's body. The device PINGS.
Batman picks up a BUNDLE. Hands it to Gordon.
BATMAN
Some of the marked bills I gave you.
GORDON
My detectives have been making drug
buys with them for weeks. This bank
was another drop for the mob. That
makes five banks- we've found the
bulk of their dirty cash.
BATMAN
Time to move in.
Gordon waves the photo.
GORDON
What about this Joker guy?
BATMAN
One man or the entire mob? He can
wait.
GORDON
We'll have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.
Gordon holds up the bundle of banknotes.
12.
GORDON
When the new DA gets wind of this,
he'll want in.
BATMAN
Do you trust him?
GORDON
Be hard to keep him out.
Gordon bags the cash.
GORDON
I hear he's as stubborn as you.
But Batman is already gone.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- MORNING
Alfred walks past soaring downtown views as he carries a
breakfast tray through the vast, empty penthouse. He stops,
looking at a still-made bed. Alfred sighs, turns.
EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING
Alfred gets out of the Rolls carrying a thermos. He walks
towards a RAILWAY BRIDGE, stops at a FREIGHT CONTAINER
sitting, lopsided, on blocks. Alfred unlocks the RUSTY
PADLOCK AND CHAIN. Steps inside.
INT. FREIGHT CONTAINER -- CONTINUOUS
Alfred FUMBLES in the dark- bangs his elbow- A HISS as the
FLOOR LOWERS... Alfred sinks down into...
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS
The container floor lowers on a giant PISTON. Alfred steps
off into a large, LOW-CEILINGED CONCRETE CHAMBER. The
Batmobile sits in the middle. Machines- 3d printers, power
tools- dot the high-tech space. At one end, Wayne sits at a
bank of monitors watching CCTV footage of the bank robbery.
ALFRED
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt
and you can swap not sleeping in a
penthouse for not sleeping in a
mansion.
Alfred places a cup of coffee in front of Wayne, who is
STITCHING up a cut on his arm.
ALFRED (CONT’D)
(takes needle)
When you stitch yourself up you make
a bloody mess.
13.
WAYNE
But I learn from my mistakes.
ALFRED
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.
WAYNE
My armor... I'm carrying too much
weight- I need to be faster.
ALFRED
I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.
(looks at wound)
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
WAYNE
A dog.
(off look)
A big dog. There were more copycats
last night, Alfred. With guns.
ALFRED
Perhaps you could hire some of them
and take weekends off.
WAYNE
This wasn't exactly what I had in
mind when I said I wanted to inspire
people.
ALFRED
I know. But things are improving.
Look at the new District Attorney...
Wayne indicates a monitor: a handsome MAN in a suit.
WAYNE
I am. Closely. I need to know if he
can be trusted.
Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.
Campaigning. Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.
ALFRED
Are you interested in his
character... or his social circle?
WAYNE
Who Rachel spends her time with is
her business.
ALFRED
Well, I trust you're not following me
on my day off.
WAYNE
If you ever took one, I might.
14.
Alfred bites the thread. Examines his stitches. Looks at
the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.
ALFRED
Know your limits, Master Wayne.
WAYNE
Batman has no limits.
ALFRED
Well, you do, sir.
WAYNE
I can't afford to know them.
ALFRED
And what happens the day you find
out?
WAYNE
We all know how much you like to say
'I told you so'.
ALFRED
That day, Master Wayne, even I won't
want to. Probably.
INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
HARVEY DENT bursts into the courtroom. Assistant D.A. RACHEL
DAWES, look up, ANNOYED.
DENT
Sorry I'm late, folks.
Rachel leans in to Dent, speaking under her breath.
RACHEL
Where were you?
DENT
Worried you'd have to step up?
RACHEL
I know the briefs backwards.
Dent pulls a large silver dollar out of his pocket. Grins.
DENT
Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll
take it. Tails, he's all yours.
Dent FLIPS. Shows it to Rachel- heads.
RACHEL
You're flipping coins to see who
leads?
15.
DENT
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.
RACHEL
I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave
things like this to chance.
DENT
I don't.
(sincere)
I make my own luck.
Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.
MARONI
I thought the DA just played golf
with the Mayor, things like that.
DENT
Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough
time to put you away for life, Sally.
The BAILIFFS lead a THIN MAN into the witness box. ROSSI.
INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
Rossi takes a SIP of water. Dent works the room.
DENT
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham,
someone must've stepped up to run the
so-called family.
(Rossi nods)
Is this man in the courtroom today?
(Rossi nods again)
Could you identify him for us,
please?
Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced. Dent smiles.
ROSSI
You win, counselor. It was me.
Dent's smile disappears. He turns back to Rossi.
DENT
I've got a sworn statement from you
that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
the new head of the Falcone crime
family.
ROSSI
Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
brains of the organization.
LAUGHS from the gallery. Dent turns to the JUDGE.
16.
DENT
Permission to treat the witness as
hostile?
ROSSI
Hostile? I'll show you hostile.
Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face. SCREAMS from
the gallery. Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with
a POP. Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with a
RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of
Maroni.
DENT
Ceramic 28 caliber. Made in China.
If you want to kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
American.
Everyone STARES, open-mouthed, as Dent adjusts his tie. The
Bailiffs are wrestling Rossi from the box-
DENT (CONT’D)
But, your honor, I'm not done...
INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY
Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.
RACHEL
We'll never link the gun to Maroni,
so we can't charge him, but I'll tell
you one thing- the fact they tried to
kill you means we're getting to them.
DENT
Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm
fine by the way.
Rachel turns to Dent. Smooths his lapels.
RACHEL
Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if
you're not getting shot at, you're
not doing your job.
(smiles)
'Course if you said you were rattled
we could take the rest of the day...
DENT
Can't. I dragged the head of the
Major Crimes Unit down here.
RACHEL
Jim Gordon? He's a friend- try to be
nice.
17.
INT. DENT'S OFFICE -- DAY
Gordon stands as Dent enters. The two men shake.
GORDON
Word is you've got a hell of a right
cross. Shame Sal's going to walk.
DENT
Well, good thing about the mob is
they keep giving you second chances.
Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.
DENT
Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy
stuff for a city cop. Have help?
GORDON
We liaise with various agencies-
DENT
Save it, Gordon. I want to meet him.
GORDON
Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.
DENT
And that flood light on top of
M.C.U.?
GORDON
If you have any concerns about...
malfunctioning equipment... take them
up with maintenance, counselor.
Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk. Annoyed.
DENT
I've put every known money launderer
in Gotham behind bars. But the mob
is still getting its money out. I
think you and your "friend" have
found the last game in town and
you're trying to hit 'em where it
hurts: their wallets. Bold. You
gonna count me in?
GORDON
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.
DENT
Gordon, I don't like that you've got
your own special unit, and I don't
like that it's full of cops I
investigated at internal affairs.
18.
GORDON
If I didn't work with cops you'd
investigated while you were making
your name at I.A.- I'd be working
alone. I don't get political points
for being an idealist- I have to do
the best I can with what I have.
Dent looks at Gordon. Considering how to proceed.
DENT
You want me to back warrants for
search and seizure on five banks
without telling me who we're after?
GORDON
I can give you the names of the
banks.
DENT
Well, that's a start. I'll get you
your warrants. But I want your
trust.
GORDON
(rises)
You don't have to sell me, Dent. We
all know you're Gotham's white
knight.
DENT
(grins)
I hear they've got a different
nickname for me down at M.C.U..
Gordon smiles.
INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
LUCIUS FOX, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and the board listen to
LAU, 40s, CEO of L.S.I. Holdings.
LAU
In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for
dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese
venture with Wayne Enterprises will
be a powerhouse.
FOX
Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of
the board, and Mr.Wayne, in
expressing our own excitement...
The Chinese look to the head of the table: Wayne, ASLEEP.
19.
INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
Fox shows Lau to the elevator. He's joined by, REESE, 30s,
an ambitious M and A consultant lawyer.
LAU
It's OK, Mr.Fox. Everyone knows who
really runs Wayne Enterprises.
FOX
We'll be in touch as soon as our
people have wrapped up the diligence.
The elevator doors close. Reese frowns.
REESE
Sir, I know Mr.Wayne's curious how
his trust fund gets replenished but
frankly... it's embarrassing.
Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.
FOX
You worry about the diligence, Mr.
Reese. I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
REESE
It's done- the numbers are solid.
FOX
(smiles)
Do it again. Wouldn't want the trust
fund to run out, would we?
INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne is standing by the window.
FOX
Another long night?
(Wayne smiles)
This joint venture was your idea, and
the consultants love it, but I'm not
convinced. L.S.I.'s grown 8 percent
annually, like clockwork. They must
have a revenue stream that's off the
books. Maybe even illegal.
WAYNE
OK. Cancel the deal.
FOX
(looks at Wayne)
You already knew.
WAYNE
I needed a closer look at their
books.
20.
Fox looks at Wayne. Wry.
FOX
Anything else you can trouble me for?
WAYNE
I need a new suit.
FOX
(looks him over)
Three buttons is a little nineties.
WAYNE
I'm not talking about fashion,
Mr.Fox, so much as function.
Wayne pulls some diagrams. Fox looks them over.
FOX
You want to be able to turn your
head?
WAYNE
Sure make backing out of the driveway
easier.
FOX
I'll see what I can do.
INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
Rachel and Dent at a table. Dent looks a little intimidated
by the surroundings.
DENT
It took three weeks to get a
reservation and I had to tell them I
worked for the government.
RACHEL
Really?
DENT
This city health inspector's not
afraid to pull strings.
Rachel smiles. Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne
enter, accompanied by a beautiful woman.
DENT
What?
WAYNE
Rachel! Fancy that.
RACHEL
Yes, Bruce. Fancy that.
21.
WAYNE
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.
NATASCHA
(Russian accent)
Hello.
DENT
The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's
told me everything about you.
WAYNE
I certainly hope not.
RACHEL
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.
WAYNE
Let's put a couple tables together.
DENT
I don't know if they'll let us-
WAYNE
They should! I own the place.
RACHEL
For how long? About three weeks?
WAYNE
How'd you know?
RACHEL
Natascha, aren't you...?
WAYNE
Prima ballerina for the Moscow
Ballet.
RACHEL
Harvey's taking me next week.
WAYNE
You're into ballet, Harvey?
RACHEL
No. He knows I am.
An extra table arrives.
INT. SAME -- LATER
They finish up dinner.
NATASCHA
No, come on- how could you want to
raise children in a city like this?
22.
WAYNE
I was raised here. I turned out OK.
DENT
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
Rachel gives Dent a withering look.
WAYNE
The Palisades? Sure. You know, as
our new D.A. you might want to figure
out where your jurisdiction ends.
NATASCHA
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante...
DENT
Gotham's proud of an ordinary man
standing up for what's right.
NATASCHA
Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
officials, not a man who thinks he's
above the law.
WAYNE
Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
DENT
We did. All of us who stood by and
let scum take control of our city.
Wayne watches Dent. Sees his passion.
NATASCHA
But this is a democracy, Harvey.
DENT
When their enemies were at the gate,
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the
city. It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered public service.
RACHEL
And the last man they asked to
protect the republic was named
Caesar. He never gave up that power.
DENT
Well, I guess you either die a hero
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain. Look,
whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to spend the rest of his life
doing this. How could he?
23.
(MORE)
~Batman's looking for someone to take
up his mantle.
NATASCHA
Someone like you, Mr.Dent?
DENT
Maybe. If I'm up to it.
Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.
NATASCHA
But what if Harvey Dent is the caped
crusader?
DENT
If I were sneaking out every night
someone would've noticed by now.
Dent takes Rachel's hand. Rachel glances at Wayne. Awkward.
WAYNE
Well, you've sold me, Dent. I'm
gonna throw you a fundraiser.
DENT
That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
not up for reelection for three
years. That stuff won't start for-
WAYNE
I don't think you understand. One
fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
need another cent.
EXT. BACK ALLEY, HOTEL, DOWNTOWN -- DAY
A line of high-end AUTOS dispenses well dressed GANGSTERS.
INT. KITCHEN, HOTEL -- DAY
The Chechen walks through a METAL DETECTOR manned by two
CHINESE. A lean, African-American man, 50's, is being
wanded. This is GAMBOL. He nods at the Chechen, wary.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS
Gotham's most notorious GANGSTERS. A door opens, and two
BURLY CHINESE enter, carrying a TV. They set it down on the
end of the table.
CRIME BOSS
The hell is this...?
The screen flickers to life: Lau. The room ERUPTS.
24.
DENT (cont'd)
LAU (ON T.V.)
Gentlemen, please. As you're all
aware, one of our deposits was
stolen. A relatively small amount:
68 million.
CHECHEN
Who's stupid enough steal from us?
LAU
I'm told the man who arranged the
heist calls himself Joker.
CHECHEN
Who the hell is that?
MARONI
Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap
purple suit and make-up. He's not
the problem- he's a nobody.
(looks at Lau)
The problem is our money being
tracked by the cops.
Murmurs of surprise.
LAU
Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed
sources we know that police have
indeed identified our banks using
marked bills and are planning to
seize your funds today-
Everyone starts SHOUTING at once.
EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN BANKS -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon sits in a SWAT van outside a bank. Stephens is
outside another. Ramirez a third...
SWAT teams CHECK WEAPONS and prepare move...
INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
Lau waits for the noise to subside.
CHECHEN
You promised safe, clean money
launder-
LAU
With the investigation ongoing, none
of you can risk hanging on to your
own proceeds. And since the
enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my
competitors out of business, I'm your
only option.
25.
MARONI
So what are you proposing?
LAU
Moving all deposits to one secure
location. Not a bank.
GAMBOL
Where, then?
LAU
Obviously, no one can know but me.
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you everyone's money
would be at stake.
CHECHEN
What stops them getting to you?
LAU
As the money is moved I go to Hong
Kong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction.
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.
From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER. It grows and
grows, until it fills the room. All eyes turn:
The Joker. Sweaty clown makeup obscuring the AWFUL SCARS
which widen his mouth into a PERMANENT, GHOULISH SMILE.
THE JOKER
I thought I told bad jokes.
GAMBOL
Give me one reason I shouldn't have
my boy here pull your head off.
The Joker pulls out a freshly sharpened pencil.
THE JOKER
How about a magic trick?
The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it
UPRIGHT.
THE JOKER (CONT’D)
I'll make this pencil disappear.
Gambol nods. His BODYGUARD MOVES at the Joker- who SIDESTEPSGRIPS
his head- SLAMS it, FACE DOWN, onto the table...
The Bodyguard goes LIMP and slides off of the table. The
PENCIL is gone. MAGIC. The Joker BOWS. Grins at Gambol.
26.
THE JOKER (CONT’D)
And by the way, the suit wasn't
cheap. You should know. You bought
it.
Gambol STANDS, furious. The Chechen stops him.
CHECHEN
Sit. I wanna hear proposition.
The Joker nods his thanks. Rises.
THE JOKER
A year ago these cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you. What
happened? Did your balls drop off?
See, a guy like me-
GAMBOL
A freak.
Laughs. Which the Joker tries to ignore.
THE JOKER
A guy like me... I know why you're
holding your little group therapy
session in broad daylight. I know
why you're afraid to go out at night.
Batman. He's shown Gotham your true
colors. And Dent's just the
beginning.
(indicates Lau)
And as for his so-called plan- Batman
has no jurisdiction. He'll find him
and make him squeal.
(smiles at Lau)
I can tell the squealers every time.
CHECHEN
What you propose?
THE JOKER
It's simple. Kill the Batman.
Jeers. Laughter.
MARONI
If it's so easy why haven't you done
it already?
THE JOKER
Like my mother used to tell me- if
you're good at something, never do it
for free.
CHECHEN
How much you want?
27.
THE JOKER
Half.
Laughter. The Joker shrugs. Rises.
THE JOKER (CONT’D)
You don't deal with this now, soon
Gambol won't even be able to get a
nickel for his grandma-
GAMBOL
Enough from the clown.
Gambol gets up, MOVING at the Joker, who casually opens his
coat, revealing EXPLOSIVES wired to his chest. Gambol stops.
THE JOKER
Let's not blow this out of all
proportion.
Gambol stares at the Joker. Hard.
GAMBOL
You think you can steal from us and
just walk away? I'm putting the word
out- 5 hundred grand for this clown
dead. A million alive, so I get to
teach him some manners, first.
The Joker shrugs. Turns to the assembled.
THE JOKER
Let me know when you change your
minds.
The Joker strolls out. Maroni turns to Lau.
MARONI
How soon can you move the money?
EXT. VARIOUS BANKS DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon hurries up the steps to a bank. SWAT teams rush the
various banks.
LAU
I already have...
EXT. UNDERPASS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS
A CHINESE MAN finishes loading a TRACTOR TRAILER with cash
boxes. The truck pulls out into a CONVOY.
INT. BANK VAULT -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon stands in an almost empty bank vault. Furious.
28.
LAU
For obvious reasons I couldn't wait
for your permission...
INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
The shot of Lau on the TV widens...
LAU
Rest assured, your money is safe.
He is already on his private jet.
IN THE SKY: THE BAT SIGNAL.
EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT
Batman emerges from the shadows. The man next to the glowing
spotlight turns: DENT.
DENT
You're a hard man to reach.
Gordon BURSTS onto the rooftop, weapon drawn. Sees Dent.
DENT
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd
asked, I could have taken his
passport- I told you to keep me in
the loop.
GORDON
Yeah? All that was left in the
vaults were the marked bills- they
knew we were coming! As soon as your
office got involved, there's a leak-
DENT
My office?! You're sitting down here
with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez...
(off look)
Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your
rookie cold on a racketeering beef.
GORDON
Don't try to cloud the fact that
clearly Maroni's got people in your
office, Dent.
Dent turns to Batman.
DENT
We need Lau back, but the Chinese
won't extradite a national under any
circumstances.
29.
BATMAN
If I get him to you, can you get him
to talk?
DENT
I'll get him to sing.
GORDON
We're going after the mob's life
savings. Things will get ugly.
DENT
I knew the risks when I took this
job, lieutenant. Same as you.
(turns to Batman)
How will you get him back, anyway?
Batman is gone. Dent looks around, startled. Gordon smirks.
GORDON
He does that.
INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY
Fox gets up from behind his desk.
FOX
Our Chinese friend left town before I
could tell him the deal is off.
WAYNE
I'm sure you've always wanted to go
to Hong Kong.
Fox opens the door to a private elevator.
INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS
Fox turns a key.
FOX
What's wrong with a phone call?
WAYNE
I think Mr.Lau deserves a more
personal touch.
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- CONTINUOUS
Fox leads Wayne off the elevator and into the vast space.
FOX
For high altitude jumps, you need
oxygen and stabilizers. I must saycompared
to your usual requests,
jumping out of an airplane is pretty
straightforward.
30.
Lucius stops at a cabinet, pulls open a drawer and hauls out
an oxygen tank and ribbed rubber hosing.
WAYNE
How about getting back into the
plane?
FOX
I can recommend a good travel agent.
WAYNE
Without it landing.
FOX
That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.
He shuts the drawer. Moves off, thinking.
FOX
I don't think I have anything here.
The CIA had a program in the '60s for
getting their people out of hot
spots. Called Sky Hook. Now-
Fox opens a cabinet to reveal COMPONENTS OF A NEW BAT-SUIT.
ARMORED PLATING secured to mesh. Wayne lifts an arm.
FOX
Hardened kevlar plates on a titaniumdipped
fiber tri-weave for
flexibility...
Wayne examines DOUBLE BLADE SCALLOPS on the gauntlet...
FOX
You'll be lighter, faster, more
agile...
Wayne flinches as the BLADES FIRE, SPINNING LIKE THROWING
STARS, NARROWLY MISSING his ear, embedding themselves in a
filing cabinet. Fox looks at him.
FOX
Perhaps you should read the
instructions, first.
WAYNE
Sorry.
Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.
FOX
Now, there's a trade-off... the
spread of the plates gives you weak
spots. You'll be more vulnerable to
gunfire and knives.
31.
WAYNE
We wouldn't want things getting too
easy, would we?
(picks up suit)
How will it hold up against dogs?
Fox looks at him quizzically.
FOX
You talking chihuahuas or rotweilers?
(Wayne smiles)
It should do fine against cats.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne examines a parachute harness. Alfred unfolds a diagram
of a NAVY CARGO PLANE with a giant "V" mounted on the front.
ALFRED
I found one. In Arizona. Very nice
man says it will take him a week to
get it running. And he takes cash.
What about a flight crew?
WAYNE
South Korean smugglers. They run
flights into Pyongyang, below radar
the whole way. Did you think of an
alibi?
Alfred looks quite pleased with himself.
ALFRED
Oh, yes.
EXT. BALLET -- NIGHT
Rachel and Dent arrive to find the box office SHUTTERED. A
sign:'PERFORMANCE CANCELED.' A newspaper story is taped to
the glass. Over a picture of BRUCE WAYNE ON A YACHT:
LOVE BOAT- Billionaire absconds with entire Moscow ballet.
EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S YACHT, THE CARIBBEAN -- DAY
Alfred, picks his way over twelve SUNBATHING BALLERINAS.
Wayne looks up from a newspaper. Alfred points to a SEAPLANE
gently touching down across the bay.
ALFRED
I believe your plane is here.
WAYNE
You look tired, Alfred. Will you be
all right without me?
A Ballerina rolls over- waves the suntan lotion at Alfred.
32.
ALFRED
If you can tell me the Russian for
'apply your own bloody suntan
lotion.’
Wayne tosses a large, waterproof kit bag into the water and
JUMPS in after it. Begins swimming over to the sea-plane.
INT. POOL HALL -- NIGHT
Gambol racks up. A bodyguard steps into the room.
BODYGUARD
Somebody here for you.
Gambol looks to the back- three rough customers are waiting.
BODYGUARD
They say they've killed the Joker.
They've come for the reward.
GAMBOL
They bring proof?
BODYGUARD
They say they've brought the body.
The bodyguards FLOP a BODY wrapped in garbage bags onto the
table. The BOUNTY HUNTERS wait in the corner. Gambol pulls
back one of the garbage bags, revealing the Joker's bloodied
face. Gambol spits. Turns to face the bounty hunters.
GAMBOL
So. Dead you get five hundred-
Behind Gambol, the Joker SITS UP- THRUSTS knives into the
bodyguards' chests. Gambol spins to see a crazy grin on the
Joker's spit-dribbled face-
THE JOKER
How about alive?
The Joker gets a switchblade in Gambol's mouth- SHARP METAL
PULLING THE CHEEK TAUT. The Bounty Hunters subdue the
remaining bodyguards.
THE JOKER
Wanna know how I got these scars? My
father was a drinker and a fiend.
He'd beat mommy right in front of me.
One night he goes off crazier than
usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself. He doesn't like
that. Not. One. Bit.
The Joker TUGS Gambols cheek with the blade.
33.
THE JOKER
So, me watching, he takes the knife
to her, laughing while he does it.
Turns to me and says 'why so
serious?' Comes at me with the knife-
'why so serious?' Sticks the blade
in my mouth- 'Let's put a smile on
that face' and...
The Joker looks up at the ASHEN FACES of the remaining Body
Guards. Smiles.
THE JOKER
Why so serious?
The Joker FLICKS his wrist- the Body Guards flinch as Gambol
goes down. The Joker turns to them.
THE JOKER
Now, our organization is small, but
we've got a lot of potential for
aggressive expansion... so which of
you fine gentlemen would like to join
our team?
The three bodyguards all nod. The Joker SNAPS a pool cue.
THE JOKER
Only one slot open right now- so
we're going to have try-outs.
The Joker drops the broken cue in the middle of the men.
THE JOKER
Make it fast.
The men stare at each other. Then at the jagged pool cue.
EXT.PENINSULA HOTEL, HONG KONG -- DAY
A HELICOPTER touches down on one of the hotel's twin
helipads. Two L.S.I. VPs approach, heads ducked. Fox gets
out- they shake hands, shouting over the engine-
VP
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.Fox! Mr.Lau
regrets he is unable to meet you in
person. But with his current legal
difficulties...!
FOX
I understand!
INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY
The VPs usher Fox towards security.
34.
VP
I'm afraid for security reasons I
have to ask for your mobile phone.
Lucius hands his phone to a SECURITY GUARD, who puts the
phone in a box underneath his station.
INT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY
Fox and Lau eat lunch in a dining room overlooking the city.
LAU
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.
This misunderstanding with the Gotham
police force... I couldn't let such
a thing threaten my company. A
businessman of your stature will
understand. But with you here... we
can continue.
FOX
Well, it was good of you to bring me
out here in such style, Mr.Lau. But
I've actually come...
A CELL PHONE rings. Fox pulls out a second, identical,
phone. Fox presses the off switch and places the phone by
his plate.
LAU
We do not allow cell phones in-
FOX
Sorry. Forgot I had it. So, I've
come to explain why we're going to
have to put our deal on hold...
Lau stares at Fox. Clearly furious. Fox smiles.
FOX
We can't afford to be seen to do
business with... well, whatever it is
you're accused of being. A
businessman of your stature will
understand.
Lau gets up. Silent. Fox retrieves his phone. Stands.
LAU
(cold)
I think, Mr.Fox, that a simple phone
call might have sufficed.
35.
FOX
Well, I do love Chinese food. And
Mr.Wayne didn't want you to think
we'd been deliberately wasting your
time.
LAU
Just accidentally wasting it.
FOX
(laughs)
That's very good- "accidentally".
Very good. I'll be sure and tell
Mr.Wayne that he was wrong about you
not having a sense of humor.
INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY
Lucius walks back through security. Nods at the VP, who
bows, offering Lucius his cell phone. Lucius shakes his
head, holds up the IDENTICAL PHONE. The VP smiles, nods,
puts the phone back into the tray with several others.
INT. HOLD, C-130 CARGO HAULER -- DAWN
Two SMUGGLERS steal glances at Wayne, crouched at the rear in
balaclava and flight suit. The COPILOT signals Wayne, who
pulls on his oxygen mask and stands up. The rear of the
plane OPENS. Wayne steps to the edge, then JUMPS.
EXT. SKIES ABOVE HONG KONG -- DAWN
Moving across the water towards Hong Kong harbor...
A tiny figure DROPS into frame, PLUMMETING towards the water-
SPEEDING past the highest floors of skyscrapers, seconds from
impact. Wayne PULLS the chute- DROPS into the water...
EXT. BENEATH FREEWAY, HONG KONG HARBOR -- DAY
Wayne pulls himself out of the water, dragging up his pack.
EXT. CENTRAL ESCALATORS -- DAY
Wayne stops halfway up the crowded commuter escalator. He
takes a camera and lines up a shot like any tourist.
FOX (O.S.)
There's a better view from the peak
tram.
Wayne turns to find Fox standing there, street map out.
WAYNE
How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?
36.
FOX
Restricted. Lau's holed up in there
good and tight. Here...
Fox shows Wayne the phone. The display: a 3-d map of Lau's
office suite. Wayne takes the phone, impressed.
WAYNE
What's this?
FOX
I had R and D work it up- it sends
out high frequencies and records the
response time to map an environment.
WAYNE
(smiles)
Sonar. Just like a b-
FOX
Submarine. Like a submarine.
WAYNE
And the other device?
FOX
In place.
Wayne nods, moves away.
FOX
Mr.Wayne?
(Wayne turns)
Good luck.
EXT. HONG KONG -- NIGHT
Moving towards the tallest building in the glittering skyline
to find Wayne, crouched on the roof. The blades of his
gauntlets CLICK into place. He dons the helmet-like cowl.
His "cape" is in the form of a hard faceted PACK.
He stands- pulls two black boxes from his belt, CLICKS them
together and UNFOLDS them into a RIFLE-LIKE DEVICE. Batman
SCOPES a second, lower building. Adjust a setting and FIRESfour
times...
Four small STICKY BOMBS SLAP onto the glass of the lower
building. They have visible timers which are COUNTING DOWN.
INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lucius' cell phone GLOWS in the box under the Security
Guard's desk. CHARACTERS race across the screen.
Then the monitor FLICKERS off, the lights DIM and all of the
security doors in the front of the building OPEN at once.
37.
The Guard grabs his radio- CALLS FOR HELP...
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING L.S.I.HOLDINGS
Batman LAUNCHES into the glittering night, DROPPING from the
tall tower... his pack BURSTS OPEN, becoming his BAT WINGS-he
GLIDES down to the lower building, STREAKING around it,
BANKING HARD to line up with a window in the rear...
INT. LAU'S OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau is talking on the phone, staring at a profit projection
on a flat screen monitor. Suddenly the room goes dark.
EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- CONTINUOUS
As Batman HURTLES towards the glass he COLLAPSES his wings,
WRAPPING his cape around himself and CANNONBALLING THROUGH
THE GLASSINT.
LAU'S OFFICE SUITE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
-ROLLING across the floor in a flurry of broken glass...
INT. LAU'S OFFICE, TOP FLOOR, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau pulls out a HANDGUN.
INT. HALLWAY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau steps into the hallway. His BODYGUARDS are waiting for
him, carrying FLASHLIGHTS.
LAU
Where the hell are the cops?
BODYGUARD
Coming.
LAU
What the hell am I paying them for?
They head for the stairwell.
EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
A small ARMY of Hong Kong police lead by a HONG KONG
DETECTIVE descends on the building.
INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau and his men make their way out onto the mezzanine.
Across the room, something makes a CRASHING SOUND. Lau's men
fan out, trying to cover the room with their flashlights.
Suddenly, one of the flashlights goes DARK. Then another.
Someone SCREAMS.
38.
Lau FIRES. Then FIRES again. The muzzle flash from his
weapon STROBES the room.
EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS, HONG KONG -- NIGHT
Cops SWARM into the building. A LOBBY SECURITY GUARD directs
the Hong Kong Detective where to go...
INT. OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau LOCKS the door. RELOADS. The door is KICKED open. Lau
FIRES. No one is there.
Lau stares, finger restless on the trigger. From his righta
NOISE. He turns and FIRES.
In the muzzle FLASH: Batman, bearing down on him like a
demon.
Lau FIRES, and FIRES again as Batman TACKLES him. Batman
pulls out a SMALL PACK- STRAPS it onto Lau-
The COUNTER on the sticky bombs hits 0-
The Hong Kong Detective and the Cops BURST into the room- the
WALL AND CEILING BEHIND BATMAN AND LAU EXPLODES- revealing
the dawn sky above Hong Kong.
The Detective looks around as he hears a LOW RUMBLE...
Batman JERKS the RIPCORD on Lau's pack. Cops cower as a
WEATHER BALLOON EXPLODES out of the pack, unreeling high-test
nylon. The Cops cock their weapons.
Lau looks up. Bemused. The weather balloon is two hundred
feet up, swaying gently. The RUMBLE BUILDS...
Suddenly, a MASSIVE C-130 ROARS over. The large V on the
front of the plane SNAGS the line- Lau and BATMAN are YANKED
THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILINGLau
SCREAMS as he and Batman SOAR UP INTO THE DAWN SKY...
The Detective looks up. Batman and Lau are gone.
INT. GORDON'S OFFICE, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Gordon is looking through case files. Ramirez walks in.
RAMIREZ
You're gonna want to see this.
EXT. MCU -- DAY
Gordon follows Ramirez through a CROWD of excited cops. On
the ground, trussed like a chicken- Lau. A sign taped to his
chest: 'Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.'
39.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Lau sits next to his sleazy lawyer, EVANS. Rachel walks in.
RACHEL
Give us the money and we'll deal.
LAU
The money is the only reason I'm
still alive.
Rachel leans forward, speaking softly. Clearly.
RACHEL
You mean when they hear that you've
helped us they're going to kill you?
EVANS
Are you threatening my client?
RACHEL
No, I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.
As will everyone.
(moves to the door)
Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.
LAU
Wait.
(Rachel stops)
I won't give you the money, but I'll
give you my clients. All of them.
RACHEL
You were a glorified accountant- what
could you have on all of them that we
could charge?
LAU
I'm good with calculation- I handled
all their investments. One big pot.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Dent hits a buzzer. Turns to Gordon.
DENT
I've got it. RICO. If their money
was pooled we can charge all of them
as one criminal conspiracy.
GORDON
Charge them with what?
Rachel enters.
40.
DENT
In a RICO case if we can charge any
of the conspirators with a felony-
RACHEL
We can charge all of them with it.
Dent nods at Rachel, excited.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Rachel comes back in.
RACHEL
Mr.Lau, do you have details of this
communal fund? Ledgers,
notebooks...?
LAU
(smiles)
Immunity, protection and a chartered
plane back to Hong Kong.
RACHEL
Once you've testified in open court.
So with your clients locked up, what
happens to all that money?
LAU
Like I said- I'm good with
calculation.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS
Dent and Gordon watch Lau.
GORDON
He can't go to County. I'll keep him
here in the holding cells.
DENT
What is this Gordon, your fortress?
GORDON
You trust them over at County?
DENT
I don't trust them here.
GORDON
Lau stays.
DENT
It's your call, Lieutenant. Be
right.
GORDON
I am, counselor.
41.
EXT. CITY HALL -- DAY
Dent stands in front of a small crowd of reporters.
REPORTER
The Chinese government claim their
international rights have been
broken.
DENT
I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements...
INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS
Dent's press conference plays on a TV in the corner.
DENT
(grins)
...but I'm sure glad he's back.
Maroni and the Chechen are watching the TV.
CHECHEN
I put word out. We hire the clown.
(off look)
He was right. We have to fix real
problem. Batman.
Maroni shakes his head. Spots Gordon walking over dangling a
pair of handcuffs. Nods at the TV.
GORDON
Our boy looks good on the tube.
MARONI
You sure you want to embarrass me in
front of my friends, Lieutenant?
GORDON
Don't worry, they're coming, too.
Gordon points out the window to a PRISON BUS.
EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN AND OUTLYING LOCATIONS -- DAY
Prison buses in every neighborhood. COPS load them with
CRIMINALS. Stephens puts Crime Boss in a prison bus.
INT. COURTROOM A, GOTHAM MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY
JUDGE SURRILLO reads the list of charges.
JUDGE SURRILLO
...849 counts racketeering, 246
counts fraud, 87 counts conspiracy
murder...
42.
Judge Surrillo turns the page. A PLAYING CARD sits there. A
Joker. He glances at it, curious, puts it to one side.
JUDGE SURRILLO
...how do the defendants plead?
An ARMY of DEFENSE LAWYERS jostle YELLING ALL AT ONCE. The
STENOGRAPHER looks up, helpless.
INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
The MAYOR, COMMISSIONER LOEB, and Gordon look up as Dent
enters.
MAYOR
DENT! What was that circus?!
DENT
I asked Gordon to make some arrests.
LOEB
(looks at report)
Five hundred and-
GORDON
Forty-nine, sir.
Gordon nods at Dent, approving. Dent grins back.
MAYOR
549 criminals at once?! How did you
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
DENT
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.
MAYOR
Even if you blow enough smoke to get
convictions out of Surrillo, you'll
set a new record at appeals for
quickest kick in the ass.
DENT
It won't matter. The head guys make
bail, sure... but the mid-level guys,
they can't, and they can't afford to
be off the streets long enough for
trial and appeal. They'll cut deals
that include some jail time. Think
of all you could do with 18 months of
clean streets.
The Mayor waves Gordon and Loeb out.
MAYOR
The public likes you, Dent. That's
the only reason this might fly.
43.
(MORE)
But that means it's on you. They're
all coming after you, now. Not just
the mob... politicians, journalists,
cops- anyone whose wallet's about to
get lighter. Are you up to it?
(Dent smiles)
You better be. They get anything on
you... those criminals will be back
on the streets...
The Mayor turns to look out of the window. Quiet.
MAYOR
Followed swiftly by you and me-
BANG! A DARK SHAPE CRACKS THE GLASS in front of the Mayor's
nose. Dent rushes to the window, looks out...
EXT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS
PEDESTRIANS look up, someone SCREAMS, someone POINTS- five
stories up... SWINGING from a FLAGPOLE...
BATMAN. HANGING BY HIS NECK. DEAD. His mouth roughly
painted in a DEMONIC CLOWN SMILE.
EXT. CITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
"Batman" is lowered from the flagpole. The same fake Batman
we saw earlier. Pinned to his chest by a KNIFE, a PLAYING
CARD. A Joker. Gordon moves closer to the body. The card
has writing on it: WILL THE REAL BATMAN PLEASE STAND UP?
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Wayne comes into the living room, excited. Alfred is
supervising party arrangements.
WAYNE
How's it going?
ALFRED
I think your fundraiser will be a
great success, sir.
WAYNE
And why do you think I wanted to hold
a party for Harvey Dent?
ALFRED
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socialising beyond myself and the
scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try
and impress Miss Dawes.
WAYNE
Very droll. But very wrong.
Actually it's Dent. You see-
44.
MAYOR (cont'd)
Wayne trails off as he spots something on the television: the
Batman HANGING as from a NEWS CAMERA, framed by a graphic
that reads 'BATMAN DEAD?'. Image cuts to Engel in the
studio.
ENGEL
...Police released video footage
found concealed on the body.
Sensitive viewers be aware: it is
disturbing.
The image cuts to a BLINDFOLDED MAN, wearing a makeshift
Batman costume- face bruised and bloody. In some kind of
bright, fluorescent-lit room.
VOICE
Tell them your name.
MAN
(weak)
Brian Douglas.
VOICE
Are you the real Batman?
MAN
No.
VOICE
Why do you dress up like him?
MAN
He's a symbol... that we don't have
to be afraid of scum like you...
VOICE
But you do, Brian. You really do.
You think the Batman's helped Gotham?
Brian nods uncertainly...
VOICE
Look at me.
(Brian looks down)
LOOK AT ME!
Brian looks up- the camera swings into the face of the Joker,
in CHALK-WHITE makeup, RED SMEAR of lipstick on his SCARS.
THE JOKER
This is how crazy Batman's made
Gotham. You want order in Gotham?
Batman has to go. So...
(leans in)
Batman must take off his mask, and
turn himself in.
45.
(MORE)
Every day he doesn't... people will
die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of
my word.
The tape cuts to STATIC.
Wayne turns to Alfred. Silent.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Dent and Rachel get off the lift. Dent stands in awe of the
penthouse and its guests.
RACHEL
Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld, scared
stiff by the trust fund brigade.
Rachel spots someone and darts off-
DENT
Rachel-
ALFRED
A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?
Dent turns to see Alfred with drinks on a silver tray.
DENT
Thanks. Alfred, right?
ALFRED
Yes, sir.
DENT
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life?
ALFRED
Not yet, sir.
DENT
(smiles, surveys crowd)
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should
be aware of?
ALFRED
Oh, you have no idea.
Alfred leaves Dent standing there, puzzled. The crowd REACTS
as a LOUD ROAR drowns conversation... Dent looks out-
EXT. HELIPAD, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne's CHOPPER touches down. He spills out with a clutch of
SUPERMODELS...
46.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne and the supermodels come out of the helipad elevator-
WAYNE
Sorry, I'm late- glad you started
without me! Where's Rachel?!
Rachel cringes slightly. Wayne spots her.
WAYNE
Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend. When
she told me she was dating Harvey
Dent, I had one thing to say... the
guy from those god-awful campaign
commercials?
Laughter. Dent shifts, embarrassed.
WAYNE
'I Believe in Harvey Dent.' Nice
slogan, Harvey. Certainly caught
Rachel's attention. But then I
started paying attention to Harvey,
and all he's been doing as our new
D.A., and you know what? I believe
in Harvey Dent. On his watch, Gotham
can feel a little safer. A little
more optimistic. So get out your
checkbooks and let's make sure that
he stays right where all of Gotham
wants him...
(raises his glass)
All except Gotham's criminals, of
course. To the face of Gotham's
bright future- Harvey Dent.
Dent smiles accepting the toast.
INT. CORRIDOR, MCU -- EVENING
Ramirez catches up to Gordon, holding paperwork.
RAMIREZ
That Joker card pinned to the body?
Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..
GORDON
Any matches?
RAMIREZ
All three.
Gordon STOPS. Turns to face her.
RAMIREZ
The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
47.
GORDON
The Joker's telling us who he's
targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's
house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get
them both into protective custody.
Where's the Commissioner?
RAMIREZ
City hall.
GORDON
Seal the building. No one in or out
till I get there.
EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Wayne walks out to the edge of the balcony and looks over
Gotham. Hears someone behind him- Rachel.
RACHEL
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you're making fun
of him. But I do.
WAYNE
(shakes his head)
I meant every word.
Wayne moves closer to Rachel. Takes her arm.
WAYNE
The day you once told me about, the
day when Gotham no longer needs
Batman. It's coming.
Rachel looks at Wayne. Conflicted. He moves closer.
RACHEL
You can't ask me to wait for that.
Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.
WAYNE
It's happening now- Harvey is that
hero. He locked up half the city's
criminals, and he did it without
wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero
with a face.
DENT
You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll
give you that. Thanks again. Mind
if I borrow Rachel?
Rachel glances back at Wayne as she moves to Dent. Wayne
watches them head inside.
48.
EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING
Two MEN in suits knock at a Brownstone. The door is opened
by Judge Surrillo. The two Men hold up BADGES.
EXT. CITY HALL -- EVENING
Gordon enters through a tight police presence at the doors.
INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- EVENING
Gordon enters to find Loeb, flanked by armed cops.
COMMISSIONER LOEB
Gordon, what are you playing at?
Gordon checks the window. Turns to his men.
GORDON
We're secure. I want a floor-byfloor
search of the entire building.
(turns to Loeb)
I'm sorry, sir. We believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.
LOEB
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover
this for yourself, so take my wordthe
Police Commissioner earns a lot
of threats...
Loeb pulls a bottle of whisky and a tumbler from a drawer.
LOEB
I found the appropriate response to
these situations a long time ago...
EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING
The second man is waiting by the Judge's car.
SURRILLO
Gordon wants me to go right now?
MAN 1
These are dangerous people, Judge.
Even we don't know where you're
going.
He hands Surrillo a sealed envelope. Opens the car door.
MAN 2
Get in, then open the envelope.
It'll tell you where you're headed.
Surrillo climbs in. Watches them drive away. She opens the
envelope- pulls out a sheet of paper. One word on it:
49.
'UP'.
Surrillo's car EXPLODES, heaving the car upwards on a
FIREBALL.
A PASSERBY is thrown to the ground. After a moment, BURNING
DEBRIS flutters down on him. PLAYING CARDS. JOKERS.
INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Loeb pours himself a glass of whisky.
LOEB
You get to explain to my wife why I'm
late for dinner, Lieutenant.
GORDON
Sir, the Joker card had a trace of
your D.N.A. on it-
A bang at the door. Gordon pulls his weapon, then opens it.
STEPHENS
Just the normal number of bad guys in
the building- and they're all city
employees. Here's a list.
LOEB
How'd they get my D.N.A.?
Gordon looks at Stephens's list.
GORDON
Somebody with access to your house or
office must've lifted a tissue or a
glass...
Gordon, realizing, spins around-
GORDON
Wait-
But Loeb is already CHOKING- he DROPS his tumbler onto the
desk- the spilled whiskey is SMOKING, eating into the wood.
GORDON
Get a medic!
Loeb COLLAPSES.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Dent pulls Rachel into the kitchen, away from the crowd.
DENT
You cannot leave me on my own with
these people.
50.
RACHEL
The whole mob's after you and you're
worried about these guys?
DENT
Compared to this, the mob doesn't
scare me. Although, I will say: them
gunning for you makes you see things
clearly.
RACHEL
Oh, yeah?
DENT
Yeah. It makes you think about what
you couldn't stand losing. And who
you want to spend the rest of your
life with...
Rachel looks at Dent. Smiles.
RACHEL
The rest of your life, huh? That's a
pretty big commitment.
DENT
Not if the mob has their way.
RACHEL
Don't.
DENT
Okay. Let's be serious. What's your
answer?
Rachel looks at him.
RACHEL
I don't have an answer.
INT.LIVING ROOM, PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Half the guests are on their cell phones. An ASSISTANT DA
turns to his COLLEAGUE.
ASSISTANT DA
Surrillo and Loeb?
There is a KNOCK at the front door. Alfred opens it it find
Detective Wuertz, who holds up his badge. Alfred beckons him
in- there is a SHOTGUN at the back of his head held by-
The Joker- purple suit, make up. With friends. The Joker
SMASHES Wuertz over the head- steps over him, RACKING the
shotgun.
51.
THE JOKER
Good evening. We're the
entertainment.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel is looking at Dent. Torn.
DENT
I guess no answer isn't "no".
RACHEL
I'm sorry, Harvey. I just...
DENT
It's someone else, isn't it?
Wayne is moving up behind him. Fast-
DENT
Just tell me it's not Wayne. The
guy's a complete-
Rachel's eyes go wide as Wayne puts Dent in a SLEEPER HOLDRACHEL
What are you doing?!
Dent SLUMPS, unconscious in Wayne's arms.
WAYNE
They've come for him.
From the main room- A SHOTGUN BLAST followed by SCREAMS.
Wayne stuffs Dent in a closet- puts a mop through the
handles. Rushes past Rachel-
WAYNE
Stay hidden.
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker and his THUGS pour into the room, weapons raised.
INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
A THUG appears in front of Wayne, toting a shotgun.
THUG
Hands up, pretty boy.
Wayne FLIPS the shotgun around in the man's hands- uses it as
a fulcrum to SNAP his forearm- SMASHES him in the jaw with
the stock without breaking step, field stripping the shotgun
and tossing the pieces in different directions.
52.
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker moves through the terrified guests. Smiling.
THE JOKER
I only have one question: where is
Harvey Dent?
(silence)
I'll settle for his loved ones...
A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path.
GENTLEMAN
We're not intimidated by thugs.
The Joker stops. Stares at the man. SMILES AFFECTIONATELY.
THE JOKER
You know, you remind me of my father.
(GRABS him)
I hated my father.
The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth.
RACHEL
Stop!
The Joker drops the Gentleman. Turns to Rachel.
THE JOKER
Hello, beautiful. You must be
Harvey's squeeze.
(runs his knife across her
cheek)
And you are beautiful. You look
nervous- it's the scars isn't it?
Wanna know how I got them? I had a
wife, beautiful like you. Who tells
me I worry too much. Who says I need
to smile more. Who gambles. And
gets in deep with the sharks. One
day they carve her face, and we've
got no money for surgeries. She
can't take it.
(presses knife into her
cheek)
I just want to see her smile again.
I just want her to know I don't care
about the scars. So I put a razor in
my mouth and do this to myself...
And you know what?
(starts laughing)
She can't stand the sight of me...
(or crying)
She leaves! See, now I see the funny
side. Now I'm always smiling.
53.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Wayne walks in. A COUPLE are hastily putting themselves back
together, alerted by the noise.
MALE GUEST
What's going on out there, Wayne?
Wayne doesn't answer. He walks into a closet and pulls at a
FALSE WALL. Wayne steps into the safe room.
FEMALE GUEST
Thank god- you've got a panic room.
The door SLAMS shut and seals with a HISS.
MALE GUEST
Wait! You can't-
FEMALE GUEST
You've got to be kidding me.
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker raises his knife from Rachel's cheek. She SLUGS
him. He smiles.
THE JOKER
A little fight in you. I like that.
BATMAN
Then you're going to love me.
The Joker turns. Batman catches him with a BLOW, spins him
down and DISARMS him- the Joker's men jump him- Batman takes
them out two at a time- DISARMING thugs- BREAKING forearmsthe
Joker CLICKS a BLADE from the toe of his shoe and KICKSJABBING
BETWEEN THE PLATES OF ARMOR covering Batman's ribcage-
Batman HURLS the Joker across the room. One of the Joker's
men LUNGES- Batman lays him out cold.
The Joker has another knife pressed to Rachel's neck.
BATMAN
Drop the knife.
THE JOKER
Sure. Just take off your mask and
show us all who you are...
Rachel shakes her head at Batman. The Joker raises his
shotgun to the side and BLOWS OUT the pane of glass next to
him. The Joker dangles Rachel out the window.
BATMAN
Let her go.
54.
THE JOKER
(laughs)
Very poor choice of words...
He lets her DROP- Rachel falls onto a SLOPING GLASS ROOFsliding
towards the edge Batman DIVES after her-
EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT
They DROP- Batman FIRES his grapple, SNAGGING Rachel's ankleactivates
one wing of his cape- They SPIN and SLOW- Batman
envelopes Rachel- they SLAM into the hood of a passing taxi.
INT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS
The DRIVER SCREAMS as Batman and Rachel hit the roof- ROLL
down the windshield- onto the pavement. Alive.
INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker looks back as his car SPEEDS away. He's breathing
hard, EXHILARATED. He touches the blood running down his
sweaty white makeup. SMACKS the back of the driver's seat-
DRIVER
What do we do about Dent?
THE JOKER
I'm a man of my word.
EXT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS
Rachel opens her eyes.
BATMAN
Are you alright?
RACHEL
Let's not do that again, okay?
(looks around)
Is Harvey-?
BATMAN
He's safe.
Rachel lies back, breathing. Looks up at Batman.
RACHEL
Thank you.
INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
STEPHENS is talking to Gordon, subdued.
STEPHENS
Jim, it's over.
55.
GORDON
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.
STEPHENS
But the prosecution's over.
STEPHENS
No-one's standing up in front of a
Judge while judges and police
commissioners are getting blown away.
GORDON
What about Dent?
STEPHENS
If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway
to Mexico by now.
The door BURSTS OPEN. Dent. Fire in his eyes.
DENT
So where do you keep your trash?
Gordon looks at Dent. Impressed.
INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Lau looks up as Dent walks in, holding a bullet proof vest.
DENT
You're due in court- I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.
LAU
No way. You can't protect me- you
can't even protect yourselves.
Dent THROWS the heavy vest at Lau.
DENT
Refuse to cooperate on the stand- you
won't be coming back here- you'll go
to county. How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne sits at his video screens- they all play the Joker's
video with different IMAGE TREATMENTS and SOUND TUNINGS.
Wayne turns to Alfred. Indicates the screens.
WAYNE
Targeting me won't get their money
back. I knew the mob wouldn't go
down without a fight, but this is
different. They've crossed a line.
56.
ALFRED
You crossed it first, sir. You've
hammered them, squeezed them to the
point of desperation. And now, in
their desperation they've turned to a
man they don't fully understand.
Wayne gets up from his monitors, raises the bat-cabinet.
WAYNE
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
We just have to figure out what he's
after.
ALFRED
Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps
this is a man you don't fully
understand, either.
ALFRED
(looks at Wayne)
I was in Burma. A long time ago. My
friends and I were working for the
local government. They were trying
to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders,
bribing them with precious stones.
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a
bandit. We were asked to take care
of the problem, so we started
looking for the stones. But after
six months, we couldn't find anyone
who had traded with him.
WAYNE
What were you missing?
ALFRED
One day I found a child playing with
a ruby as big as a tangerine.
(shrugs)
The bandit had been throwing the
stones away.
WAYNE
So why was he stealing them?
ALFRED
Because he thought it was good sport.
Because some men aren't looking for
anything logical, like money... they
can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or
negotiated with.
(grave)
Some men just want to watch the world
burn.
Wayne stares at Alfred. Reaches for the bat-suit.
57.
EXT. SKYLINE OF GOTHAM -- DAWN
MOVING over the city we hear myriad RADIO CALLS going out
over the ether. CLOSE IN on a lonely figure on top of a
skyscraper. The Batman. Listening with his million dollar
earpieces. From the babble, ONE VOICE EMERGES.
DISPATCH (O.S.)
Your name, sir. Please state-
VOICE (O.S.)
8th at orchard. You'll find Harvey
Dent there.
EXT. 8TH STREET AT ORCHARD -- DAWN
An UNMARKED and a SQUAD CAR screech to a halt. Gordon and
Ramirez get out, lead two UNIFORMS into the building.
INT. APARTMENT, EIGHT AVE. -- CONTINUOUS
The door SMASHES OPEN, Gordon- gun drawn- takes in the scene.
TWO DEAD MEN sitting at the kitchen table. They each have a
HAND OF CARDS, as if in the middle of a game. ALL JOKERS.
Gordon and Ramirez STARE at the CRUDE LEERS carved into their
faces. Their DRIVERS LICENSES are pinned to their chests.
VOICE
Check the names.
GORDON
(checks licenses)
Patrick Harvey. Richard Dent...
RAMIREZ
Harvey Dent.
BATMAN
I need ten minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.
RAMIREZ
Us contaminate it? It's because of
you that these guys are dead in the
first place-
GORDON
Ramirez.
She stands down. Batman moves past the bodies to the wall.
Finds an embedded stray bullet. He pulls a SAWING DEVICE
from his belt- THRUSTS it into the wall and starts cutting
around the bullet.
GORDON
That's brick- you're gonna try and
take ballistics off a shattered
bullet?
58.
BATMAN
No. Fingerprints.
Ramirez looks at Gordon. Is he serious? Gordon points-
GORDON
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast,
'cos we know his next target...
Batman looks- a campaign poster: RE-ELECT MAYOR GARCIA. The
Mayor's image has a MANIC CLOWN'S GRIN and "HA,HA,HA".
INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
Fox is at his desk. Reese enters.
FOX
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
REESE
You asked me to do the diligence on
the L.S.I.Holdings deal again. I
found irregularities.
FOX
Their CEO is in police custody.
REESE
Not with their numbers. With yours.
A whole division of Wayne Industries
disappeared, overnight. So I went
down to the archives and started
pulling old files.
He pulls out a folded blueprint. Slides it across the desk.
REESE
My kids love the Batman. I thought
he was pretty cool, too. Out there,
kicking some ass.
Fox picks up the piece of paper. Unfolds it. It's an old
BLUEPRINT. The image is unmistakable: THE TUMBLER.
REESE
Changes things when you know it's
just a rich kid playing dress up.
Reese points to the approval box in the corner of the page.
REESE
Your project. Don't tell me you
didn't recognize your baby pancaking
cop cars on the evening news. Now
you're getting sloppy. Applied
Sciences was a small, dead departmentwho'd
notice?
59.
(MORE)
But now you've got the entire R and D
department burning cash, claiming
it's related to cell phones for the
army. What are you building him now?
A rocket ship? I want ten million a
year. For the rest of my life.
Fox looks at him. Even. Folds up the blueprint.
FOX
Let me get this straight. You think
that your client, one of the
wealthiest and most powerful men in
the world, is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare
hands...
(deadpan)
And now your plan is to blackmail
this person?
Reese stares at Fox. Who smiles. And slides the blueprint
across the desk.
FOX
Good luck.
Reese looks at it. Then at Fox. Swallows. Slides it back.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne hands Alfred a RIFLE BULLET scribed with a GRID. He
slots it into a clip, then loads it into a COMPUTER
CONTROLLED GATTLING GUN. He puts on ear protectors. Hits a
button.
The rifle WHIRS to life- dollying sideways, BLASTING BULLETS
into a series of identical BRICK WALL SAMPLES.
ALFRED
I'm not sure you made it loud enough,
sir.
As the wall samples still smoke, Wayne steps up, carrying the
sample from the crime scene. Comparing its spread to the new
samples, he selects two and carries them to an X-RAY SCANNER.
The machine gives the samples a 3-axis scan- HI-RES 3-D
IMAGES of the bullet fragment arrays come up on the screen...
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY
The same image of the bullet fragment on a screen. Fox hits
a key and the computer 'reassembles' the bullets according to
the identifying grid on each fragment.
FOX
Here's your original scan...
60.
REESE (cont'd)
A bullet fragment array pops on screen.
FOX
Here's it reverse-engineered...
Fox hits a button and the unmarked bullet fragments are
reassembled. Wayne spins the roughly-shaped bullet puzzle-
WAYNE
And here's a thumb print.
Fox looks at the screen, impressed. Thinks.
FOX
I'll make you a copy.
(troubled)
Mr.Wayne, did you reassign R and D?
WAYNE
Yes. Government telecommunications
project.
FOX
I wasn't aware we had any new
government contracts. Can you-
WAYNE
Lucius. I'm playing this one pretty
close to the chest.
FOX
Fair enough.
Fox looks at Wayne as he leaves. Uneasy.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS -- INTERCUT
Wayne examines the fingerprint-
WAYNE
I've run it through all the databases
and came up with four possibles.
Wayne gets up to let Alfred sit.
WAYNE (CONT’D)
Cross-reference the addresses.
Look for Parkside and around.
Wayne opens a HYDRAULIC DOOR, revealing a gleaming MV AUGUSTA
BRUTALE. As he moves the bike onto the lift...
ALFRED
Got one. Melvin White, aggravated
assault, moved to Arkham twice- 1502
Randolph Apartments, just off State-
61.
WAYNE
Overlooking the parade.
Wayne and the bike rise on the lift.
EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- DAY
The avenue has been blocked off. Onlookers line the
sidewalks. POLICE march past in dress uniform. Engel does a
stand-up on the sidewalk.
ENGEL
With no word from the Batman- even as
they mourn Commissioner Loeb, these
cops have to be wondering if the
Joker is going to make good on his
threat to kill the Mayor today...
On the buildings above, POLICE SNIPERS scan the crowd.
Gordon keys his radio-
GORDON
How's it looking up top?
POLICE SNIPER
We're tight. But frankly... there's
a lot of windows up here.
Gordon looks up at the myriad buildings overlooking the
podium.

Wayne maneuvers the Ducati through the traffic. He pulls up
near a parade barricade- dismounts and slips into an alley.
INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Some of the building's hard-luck TENANTS eye Wayne as he
counts doors down the hallway. He finds 1502...

A SEA OF POLICE fills the Avenue. In the center, three
grieving families and an HONOR GUARD. The Mayor at the

THE MAYOR

of these officers, we must remember
that vigilance is the price of
safety.

On the podium, Stephens rolls Gordon over... he is not

CHAOS. Dent approaches an ambulance sitting in the alley.
Two cops jump out and run over to their commander. Dent
steps up into the back.
INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker's thug sits there. Handcuffed. A PARAMEDIC
bandages his leg. Cops run past, barking orders.
DENT
Tell me what you know about the
Joker.
63.
The Joker's thug looks at Dent. Smirks. Dent looks down.
Exasperated. Looks back up at the Joker's Thug. Spots
something- moves closer- the man's uniform... his name tag...
OFFICER RACHEL DAWES.
Dent, breathing hard, looks around: the paramedic jumps out,
rushing to help a FALLEN OFFICER. Dent spies the keys in the
ignition. Jumps into the driver's seat...
EXT. GORDON'S HOUSE -- DUSK
Barbara Gordon stands in the doorway, scared. Stephens and a
UNIFORMED OFFICER stand in front of her.
STEPHENS

Barbara tries to push him back inside.
BARBARA
Jimmy, go play with your sister...
James stays just inside the door.
STEPHENS
I'm sorry.
Barbara stares at Stephens. Then looks past him.
BARBARA
Are you out there?! Are you?!
James spots something- Batman, perched in the shadows.
BARBARA
You brought this on us! This
craziness! You did! You brought
this...!
She collapses into Stephens's arms. Batman hangs his head.
EXT. ROOF, MCU -- NIGHT
Detectives from MCU stand around the lit bat-signal.
STEPHENS
Switch it off- he ain't coming.
He doesn't want to talk to us. God
help whoever he does want to talk to-
INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
Strobe lights. Pounding music. Maroni is in a booth at the
side with his MISTRESS. His bodyguards are around the table.
64.
MISTRESS
(shouting over music)
Can't we go someplace quieter! We
can't hear each other talk!
MARONI
I don't wanna hear you talk.
MISTRESS
(can't hear)
What?!
One of Maroni's Bodyguards DROPS- Maroni looks over- in the
strobe lights- Batman SAVAGES his bodyguards- people RUN,
TERRIFIED. Maroni starts to get out of his seat- Batman
LANDS like a panther on the table in front of him-

Rachel moves through the chaotic bullpen at MCUEYEWITNESSES,
civilian and cop are being questioned.
Rachel's phone rings.
RACHEL
Harvey, where are you?!
INTERCUT with Dent in an INDISTINCT interior setting.
DENT
Where are you?
RACHEL
Where you should be- at Major Crimes
trying to sort through all the-
DENT
Rachel, listen to me. You're not
safe there.
RACHEL
This is Gordon's unit, Harvey-
DENT
Gordon's gone, Rachel.
RACHEL
He vouched for these men-
DENT
And he's gone. The Joker's named you
next.
Rachel looks around the bullpen. Eyeing the detectives.
DENT
Rachel, I can't let anything happen
to you. I love you too much.
65.
(MORE)
Is there someone, anyone in this city
we can trust?
RACHEL
Bruce. We can trust Bruce Wayne.
DENT
Rachel, I know he's your friend but-
RACHEL
Trust me, Harvey, Bruce's penthouse
is now the safest place in the city.
DENT
Okay. Go straight there. Don't tell
anyone where you're going. I'll find
you there.
Wider shows us we are-
INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
DENT

blindfold...
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT
Maroni opens his eyes. Batman is holding him by the collar.
BATMAN
I want the Joker.
MARONI
(looks down)
From one professional to another-if
you're trying to scare someone, pick
a better spot. From this height the
fall wouldn't kill me.
BATMAN
I'm counting on it.
Batman lets go. Maroni FALLS. And SCREAMS.
EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT
Maroni NAILS the pavement. CLUTCHES at his leg, which is
badly broken. Batman FLIES down, landing over him- hauls him
up. Maroni HOLLERS in pain.
BATMAN
Where is he?
MARONI
I don't know, he found us-
66.
DENT (cont'd)
BATMAN
He must have friends.
MARONI
Friends? You met this guy?
BATMAN
Someone knows where he is.
Maroni looks up at Batman. Sneering.
MARONI
No one's gonna tell you anythingthey're
wise to your act- you got
rules... the Joker, he's got no
rules. No one's gonna cross him for
you. You want this guy, you got one
way. And you already know what that
is. Just take off that mask and let
him come find you.
Batman DROPS Maroni.
MARONI
Or you want to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up
your mind?
INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- NIGHT
Dent shows the Joker's Thug a GUN. Bullets. Loads the gun.
SHOVES it in his face-
DENT
You wanna play games?
Dent PUSHES the gun against the thug's head with REAL MALICE.
Pulls it away and FIRES. The Thug FLINCHES. Dent puts the
gun barrel against the thug's temple-
JOKER'S THUG
(rattled)
You wouldn't...
And pulls his lucky coin out of his pocket.
DENT
No. I wouldn't. That's why I'm not
going to leave it up to me.
(shows him coin)
Heads- you get to keep your head.
Tails... not so lucky. So, you want
to tell me about the Joker?
The Thug, scared, says nothing. Dent FLICKS the coin into
the air. SLAPS it onto the back of his gun hand (aiming with
wrist horizontal). Dent shows him the coin. Heads. The
Thug exhales, SHAKING.
67.
DENT
Go again?
JOKER'S THUG
(sobbing)
I don't know anything!
DENT
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Dent tosses the coin again. This time IT DOESN'T LAND. Dent
looks up. Batman is there.
BATMAN
You'd leave a man's life to chance?
DENT
Not exactly.
BATMAN
His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a
paranoid schizophrenic, a former
patient at Arkham. The kind of mind
the Joker attracts.
Batman moves away from Schiff.
BATMAN
What do expect to learn from him?
Dent is shivering with frustration.
DENT
The Joker killed Gordon- and, and
Loeb. He's going to kill Rachel...
BATMAN
You're the symbol of hope that I
could never be. Your stand against
organized crime is the first
legitimate ray of light in Gotham for
decades. If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone- all the
criminals you got off the streets
would be released. And Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.
Batman hands Dent his lucky coin.
BATMAN
You're going to call a press
conference. Tomorrow morning.
DENT
Why?
68.
BATMAN
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands, now.
DENT
You can't! You can't give in!
But Batman is gone.
INT. BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel watches Gotham through the window. Wayne enters.
RACHEL
Harvey called. He says Batman is
going to turn himself in.
WAYNE
I have no choice.
RACHEL
You honestly think it's going to stop
the Joker from killing?
WAYNE
Perhaps not. But I've got enough
blood on my hands. I've seen, now,
what I would have to become to stop
men like him.
Rachel looks at Wayne. She cannot help him.
WAYNE
You once told me that if the day came
when I was finished...
Wayne moves towards her.
WAYNE
We'd be together.
RACHEL
Bruce, don't make me your one hope
for a normal life-
Wayne takes her in his arms.
WAYNE
But did you mean it?
RACHEL
Yes.
They kiss. Then separate. She looks sadly into his eyes.
RACHEL
But they won't let us be together
after you turn yourself in.
69.
Wayne nods. Leaves. She watches him go.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAWN
Alfred shovels DOCUMENTS into an incinerator- blueprints,
designs, files. He pauses, looking down at a book.
ALFRED
Even the logs?
WAYNE
Anything that could lead back to
Lucius or Rachel.
Alfred tosses the book onto the fire. STARES at Wayne.
WAYNE
People are dying, Alfred. What would
you have me do?
Alfred looks into Wayne's eyes with a fearsome gaze.
ALFRED
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
They'll hate you for it, but that's
the point of Batman... he can be the
outcast. He can make the choice no
one else can face. The right choice.
Wayne shakes his head.
WAYNE
Today I've found out what Batman
can't do. He can't endure this.
(rueful smile)
Today you get to say 'I told you so'.
ALFRED
Today, I don't want to.
(beat)
Although I did bloody tell you.
Wayne sinks the Bat-suit, Alfred closes the incinerator.
They head for the lift.
ALFRED
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
Your accomplice.
WAYNE
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.
They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.

INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
A capacity crowd of REPORTERS, COPS, and PUBLIC. Dent is at
the podium. Wayne sits in the crowd.
DENT
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for
coming. I've called this press
conference for two reasons. Firstly,
to assure the citizens of Gotham that
everything that can be done over the
Joker killing is being done.
Secondly, because the Batman has
offered to turn himself in-
The crowd REACTSHECKLER
So where is he?!
DENT
But first. Let's consider the
situation: should we give in to this
terrorist's demands? Do we really
think that-
REPORTER
You'd rather protect an outlaw
vigilante than the lives of
citizens?!
The crowd noisily assents. Dent calmly motions quiet.
DENT
The Batman is an outlaw...
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.
DENT (O.S.)
But that's not why we're demanding he
turn himself in. We're doing it
because we're scared. We've been
happy to let Batman clean up our
streets for us until now-
INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS
HECKLER
Things are worse than ever!
Wayne looks at the Heckler. At the angry crowd. Dent leans
over the podium. Impassioned.
DENT
Yes. They are. But the night is
darkest just before the dawn.
71.
(MORE)
And I promise you, the dawn is
coming.
(the crowd quiets)
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken- but
to us, not to this madman.
The crowd seems moved by his words, then, a CHANTCOP
HECKLER
NO MORE DEAD COPS!!
Appreciative noise.
REPORTER
WHERE IS THE BATMAN?
People take up the chant. Dent has lost them. He knows it.
DENT
So be it.
(turns to officers)
Take the Batman into custody.
At this, a HUSH DESCENDS. Wayne is sitting towards the back.
Hungry eyes scan the room. Wayne starts to rise... DENT

I am the Batman.

Rachel STARES as Dent is arrested on TV. Appalled.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Rachel comes up to Alfred. Upset.
RACHEL
Why is he letting Harvey do this,
Alfred?
ALFRED
I don't know. He went down to the
press conference-
RACHEL
And just stood by?!
ALFRED
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent
believe that Batman stands for
something more important than a
terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even
if everyone hates him for it.
72.
DENT (cont'd)
(MORE)
That's the sacrifice he's making- to
not be a hero. To be something more.
RACHEL
Well, you're right about one thingletting
Harvey take the fall is not
heroic.
Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.
RACHEL
You know Bruce best, Alfred... give
it to him when the time is right.
ALFRED
How will I know?
RACHEL
It's not sealed.
Alfred takes the envelope. Rachel gives him a kiss.
RACHEL
Goodbye, Alfred.
ALFRED
Goodbye, Rachel.
INT. CELL, MCU -- EVENING
A Detective unlocks the cell and lets Rachel inside.
DENT
I'm sorry, I didn't have time to talk
this through with you.
RACHEL
Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.
DENT
They're transferring me to central
holding. This is the Joker's chance,
and when he attacks, Batman will take
him down.
RACHEL
No. This is too dangerous-
The Detective knocks. Dent rises.
EXT. COURTYARD MCU -- EVENING
Detectives stare at Dent as he is led, shackled, to the
waiting CONVOY. Stephens begins CLAPPING- a handful join in,
but most remain silent. Rachel follows him to the back of an
armored vehicle.
73.
ALFRED (cont'd)
RACHEL
He's using you as bait- but he
doesn't know if he can get the Jokerhe's
failed so far.
DENT
How do you know what he's thinking?
RACHEL
(beat)
I just do, okay? Harvey, this isn't
just about you, what about all the
people counting on you to turn this
city around? Tell everyone the truth-
Dent kisses her. Pulls out his LUCKY COINDENT
Heads I go through with it.
RACHEL
This is your life... you don't leave
something like this to chance...
Dent tosses it at her- Rachel catches it. Looks. Heads.
DENT
(sincere)
I'm not.
She turns it over: IT IS DOUBLE-HEADED. She looks up- the
DOORS CLOSE on his smile. She shakes her head. Torn.
RACHEL
You make your own luck.

Dent looks up as the door swings open to reveal Gordon. Dent
GRINS.
DENT
Lieutenant, you do like to play it
pretty close to the chest...
GORDON
We got him, Harvey.
Dent nods. Respect in his eyes. They shake hands.
EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT
A small army of cops have sealed off the roadway. Gordon
pulls away in the squad car containing the Joker.
REPORTERS clamor for an interview with Dent, who is being
helped out of the van by the SWATS. Ramirez pushes through
the pack, shoving reporters aside.
RAMIREZ
Let him be! He's been through enough-
Dent follows Ramirez to a squad car- Wuertz is in the
driver's seat. Dent smiles at Ramirez as she opens the rear
door.
DENT
Thanks, detective- I've got a date
with a pretty upset fiancée.
RAMIREZ
I figured, counselor.
Ramirez shuts the door on Dent. Signals Wuertz to pull out.
INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker sits in a holding cage. His makeup has run, his
clothes a mess- but his calm lends him an odd dignity. COPS
SMASH their night sticks against the bars near the Joker's
head. The Joker does not flinch.
GORDON
Stand away! All of you. I don't
want anything for his mob lawyer to
use, understand? Handle this guy
like he's made of glass.
The Mayor walks in. Shakes Gordon's hand.
MAYOR
Back from the dead.
82.
GORDON
I couldn't chance my family's safety.
The Mayor looks over at the Joker in his cage.
MAYOR
What do we got?
GORDON
Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA,
dental. Clothing is custom, no
labels. Nothing in his pockets but
knives and lint. No name, no other
alias... nothing.
MAYOR
Go home, Gordon. The clown'll keep
till morning. Get some rest- you're
going to need it. Tomorrow, you take
the big job.
(off look)
You don't have any say in the matter.
(louder, for all)
Commissioner Gordon.
The cops in M.C.U. start CHEERING.
EXT. GORDON HOME -- NIGHT
Gordon rings the bell. Barbara answers it, dressed in black.
GORDON
I couldn't tell you. I couldn't risk-
She SLAPS Gordon. He grabs her, holds her tight as she sobs.
INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker's men are processed. In the harsh light, the men
look a little ridiculous in their clown make-up. DETECTIVE
MURPHY turns to Stephens.
DETECTIVE MURPHY
Look at these ugly bastards.
One of the men, walks over, clutching at his belly.
FAT THUG
I don't feel good.
DETECTIVE MURPHY
You're a cop killer. You're lucky to
be feeling anything below the neck.
Alone in his cage, the Joker smiles at this.
83.
INT. KIDS' BEDROOM, GORDON HOME -- NIGHT
Gordon crouches by his son's beside. He reaches out to touch
James Jr's cheek. James's eyes open. Staring at his dad as
if still dreaming.
JAMES
(whispers)
Did Batman save you, dad?
Gordon looks at his son. A little pride seeps in.
GORDON
Actually, this time I saved him.
Gordon's phone rings-
INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Gordon PUSHES through the swarm of detectives crowded into
the observation room. The Joker can be seen through the
glass, as well as on a large MONITOR. Sitting there. Calm.
GORDON
Has he said anything, yet?
Ramirez shakes her head. Gordon PUSHES through a door...
INT. INTERROGATION, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker, in near darkness. Gordon walks in. Sits.
THE JOKER
Evening, Commissioner.
GORDON
Harvey Dent never made it home.
THE JOKER
Of course not.
GORDON
What have you done with him?
THE JOKER
(laughs)
Me? I was right here. Who did you
leave him with? Your people?
Assuming, of course, that they are
your people not Maroni's...
(off look)
Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to
know how alone you are?
Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA.
84.
THE JOKER
Does it make you feel responsible for
Harvey Dent's current predicament?
GORDON
Where is he?
THE JOKER
What time is it?
GORDON
What difference does that make?
THE JOKER
Depending on the time, he might be in
one spot.
(smiles)
Or several.
Gordon stands. Moves to the Joker. Undoes his handcuffs.
GORDON
If we're going to play games, I'm
going to need a cup of coffee.
THE JOKER
The good cop, bad cop routine?
Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob.
GORDON
Not exactly.
Gordon steps out. The overhead lights COME ON. BATMAN IS
BEHIND HIM. The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT.
WHAM! The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air-
CRACK! CRACK! To the head. Batman is in front of him. The
Joker stares, fascinated. Bleeding.
THE JOKER
Never start with the head... victim
gets fuzzy. Can't feel the next-
CRACK! Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers.
THE JOKER
(calm)
See?
BATMAN
You wanted me. Here I am.
THE JOKER
I wanted to see what you'd do. And
you didn't disappoint...
(laughs)
You let five people die.
85.
(MORE)
Then you let Dent take your place.
Even to a guy like me... that's cold-
BATMAN
Where's Dent?
THE JOKER
Those mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.
But I know the truth- there's no
going back. You've changed things.
Forever.
BATMAN
Then why do you want to kill me?
The Joker starts LAUGHING. After a moment he's laughing so
hard it sounds like SOBBING.
THE JOKER
Kill you? I don't want to kill you.
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No
you...
(points)
You. Complete. Me.
BATMAN
You're garbage who kills for money.
THE JOKER
Don't talk like one of them- you're
not, even if you'd like to be. To
them you're a freak like me... they
just need you right now.
He regards Batman with something approaching pity.
THE JOKER
But as soon as they don't, they'll
cast you out like a leper.
The Joker looks into Batman's eyes. Searching.
THE JOKER
Their morals, their code... it's a
bad joke. Dropped at the first sign
of trouble. They're only as good as
the world allows them to be. You'll
see- I'll show you... when the chips
are down, these civilized people...
they'll eat each other.
(grins)
See, I'm not a monster... I'm just
ahead of the curve.
Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright.
86.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
One of the Detectives moves for the door. Gordon stops him.
GORDON
He's in control.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Batman HOISTS the Joker up by the neck.
BATMAN
Where's Dent?
THE JOKER
You have these rules. And you think
they'll save you.
BATMAN
I have one rule.
THE JOKER
Then that's the one you'll have to
break. To know the truth.
BATMAN
Which is?
THE JOKER
(smiles)
The only sensible way to live in this
world is without rules. Tonight
you're going to break your one
rule...
Batman leans in to the Joker.
BATMAN
I'm considering it.
THE JOKER
There are just minutes left- so,
you'll have to play my little game if
you want to save...
(with relish)
...one of them.
BATMAN
Them?
THE JOKER
For a while I thought you really were
Dent, the way you threw yourself
after her-
Batman DROPS the Joker- RIPS up a bolted-down chair-
87.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Gordon MOVES for the door-
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU -- CONTINUOUS
Batman JAMS the chair under the doorknob- PICKS up the Joker
and HURLS him into the two-way glass. The glass SPIDERS.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker, bleeding from nose and mouth, LAUGHS at Batman.
THE JOKER
Look at you go... does Harvey know
about you and his-?
The Joker SMASHES into the wall- SLIDES to the floor. Batman
stands over him, a man possessed-
BATMAN
WHERE ARE THEY?!
He GRABS the Joker, holding him close-
THE JOKER
Killing is making a choice...
Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face. HARD.
BATMAN
WHERE ARE THEY?!
The Joker FEEDS off Batman's anger. Loving it.
THE JOKER
...you choose one life over the
other. Your friend, the district
attorney. Or his blushing bride-tobe.
Batman PUNCHES the Joker again. The Joker LAUGHS.
THE JOKER
You have nothing. Nothing to
threaten me with. Nothing to do with
all your strength...
(spits a tooth)
But don't worry, I'm going to tell
you where they are. Both of them,
and that's the point- you'll have to
choose.
The Batman stares at the Joker...
THE JOKER
He's at 250 52nd Boulevard. And
she's on avenue X at Cicero.
88.
Batman DROPS him.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Batman RACES past Gordon.
GORDON
Which one are you-
BATMAN
Dent knew the risks.
Gordon looks back- the Joker is bloody, but grinning.
EXT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Several cops see Batman climb onto the bat-pod and TEAR off.
EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Batman SWERVES into oncoming traffic, CHAOS in his wake.
EXT. GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Gordon and his men SCRAMBLE into their cars...
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Black.
RACHEL
Can anyone hear me?
Harvey Dent opens his eyes. He's bound to a chair in a
dingy, unfurnished basement apartment.
DENT
Rachel? Rachel is that you?
RACHEL
(sobbing)
Harvey. You're OK. I thought...
Her voice is coming from a speakerphone on the floor.
DENT
It's OK, Rachel. Everything's going
to be just fine.
He looks around. Behind him, metal BARRELS, hooked up to a
car battery, with a TIMER counting down: five minutes.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker sits, smiling, content. Stephens guards the door.
THE JOKER
I want my phone call.
89.
STEPHENS
That's nice.
THE JOKER
How many of your friends have I
killed?
STEPHENS
I'm a twenty year man. I can tell
the difference between punks who need
a little lesson in manners, and the
freaks like you who would just enjoy
it.
(quiet)
And you killed six of my friends.
INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Fat Thug shuffles to the bars, where a COP stands guard.
FAT THUG
(agony)
Please. My insides hurt.
COP
Step away from the bars.
FAT THUG
The boss said he would make the
voices go away. He said he would go
inside and replace them with bright
lights. Like Christmas.
COP
That's great. Please step-
The Fat Thug COLLAPSES. The Cop grabs his radio.
INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel is bound to a chair. Behind her are barrels identical
to the ones behind Dent.
DENT
Can you move your chair?
RACHEL
No. Harvey, we don't have much time-
The timer connected to the bomb reads 2.47... 2.46...
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Dent DRAGS his chair, inching closer to the barrels.
DENT
Look for something to free yourself.
90.
The chair JAMS against a ridge in the floor. Dent STRAINS to
reach the timer. Inches shy.
RACHEL
They said only one of us was going to
make it. That they'd let our...
(pause)
Our friends choose...
Dent strains... THE CHAIR, AND DENT, TOPPLE OVER- KNOCKING
OVER A BARREL.
RACHEL
Harvey? What's happening?
Dent, one side of his face pressed against the bare floor,
watches the open barrel SPEW DIESEL FUEL around him-
DENT
Nothing. I'm trying to...
Dent contorts his head to keep from swallowing any.
EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
The bat-pod SKIDS SIDEWAYS, WHEELS FLIPPING as the gyro keeps
Batman upright on the tumbling bike- it comes to rest- guns
lined up with a fire exit- BLOWS the door off its hinges-
JUMPS off the bike-
EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Gridlock. Gordon SWERVES onto the sidewalk. People SCATTER.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker sits like a kid kept after class. He smiles.
THE JOKER
You know why I use a knife,
Detective? Guns are too quick. You
don't get to savor all the little
emotions. See, in their last
moments, people show you who they
really are...
Stephens tries hard to ignore him. It isn't working.
THE JOKER
So, in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.
(smiles)
Would you like to know which of them
were really cowards?
91.
STEPHENS
(rolls up sleeves)
I know you're going to enjoy this.
But I'm going to enjoy it more.
Stephens PUNCHES the Joker in the gut.
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Dent is half submerged in diesel fuel.
RACHEL
Harvey, in case... I want you to know
something...
Dent CHOKES, his emotions overwhelming him.
DENT
Don't think like that, Rachel.
They're coming for you.
RACHEL
I know, but I don't want them to...
INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel looks at the timer. Ten seconds left.
RACHEL
I don't want to live without you.
Because I do have an answer, and my
answer is yes...
INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
A MEDIC CUTS away the Fat Thug's shirt- his belly has large
INCISION, which has been closed with crude looking STITCHESMEDIC
He's got some kind of... contusion...
A RECTANGULAR SHAPE is visible under the skin above his
navel.
INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Stephens shuffles out into the room, a piece of BROKEN GLASS
held to his THROAT by the Joker. Cops draw their weapons.
STEPHENS
This is my own damn fault. Just
shoot him.
DETECTIVE MURPHY
What do you want?
THE JOKER
I want my phone call.
92.
The Detectives look at each other. One of them pulls out his
cell phone. TOSSES it to the Joker, who begins to dial.
INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Medic gingerly PRESSES the rectangle. It illuminates, a
soft blue light visible through the skin.
COP
Is that a... phone?
INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker presses SEND. At the end of the room, the door to
the holding area EXPLODESINT.
HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT
Batman SPRINTS down the hall- stops at a door- KICKS it-
EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Cars PULL UP- Gordon gets out, carrying a fire ax-
INT. HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT
Batman KICKS- the door gives- Batman SMASHES it open-
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
...Batman BURSTS through the door- Dent looks up in horror-
DENT
NO! Not me... Why did you come for
me?!
Batman STARES at Dent. The Joker lied. The counter hits 5
seconds. Batman DRAGS Dent out- Dent FIGHTS to stay-
DENT
RACHEL!
RACHEL
Harvey? Harvey, it's okay...
DENT
RACHEL!!!
EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Gordon, axe in hand, RUNS towards the entrance-
INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel can hear Dent. The counter runs out.
93.
RACHEL
(calm)
Somewhere-
AN EXPLOSION. ALL-CONSUMING.
EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
The BLAST HURLS Gordon backward onto the hood of his car- THE
ENTIRE WAREHOUSE IS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSIONINT.
BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Batman wraps his cape around Dent and hurls them both through
the door. Dent is SCREAMINGEXT.
52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Gordon picks himself up. The warehouse is an inferno. He
heads for it anyway. Five of his men have to RESTRAIN HIM.
EXT. ALLEYWAY, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
A SECOND EXPLOSION- Batman COVERS Dent as the FIREBALL HITS
them- IGNITING the diesel soaking Dent's left side- he starts
BURNING. And stops screaming. Batman ROLLS Dent on the wet
pavement... Dent SIZZLES. Silent.
INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker walks to the bars of another cell. Grins.
THE JOKER
Hello there.
In his cell. Terrified. Lau.
EXT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
Dent is wheeled into an ambulance, bandages held to his face.
His one visible eye STARES BLANKLY, oblivious to the panic-
EXT. 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches the fire. DEBRIS blows across the asphalt.
Gordon picks up two pieces: SINGED JOKER CARDS. In place of
the Joker's face is a PHOTO OF LAU. A POLICE SERGEANT
approaches.
SERGEANT
Dent's alive, Jim. Just. But back
at M.C.U.... the Joker's gone...
GORDON
With Lau?
(the Cop nods)
The Joker planned to be caught. He
wanted me to lock him up in M.C.U..
94.
EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAWN
A squad car BLAZES down the street. The Joker sticks his
head out the window like a dog, feeling the wind...
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN
Alfred sits at a table reading the letter from Rachel.
RACHEL (V.O.)
Dear Bruce, I need to explain...
EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN
Water. Smoldering blackness. The FIRE CREWS extinguish the
last flames of the devastated building. A FIREMAN nudges his
COLLEAGUE, pointing out something in the devastation...
RACHEL (V.O.)
...I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent...
INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT -- DAWN
Glimpses of Dent's damaged face as SURGEONS surround him.
RACHEL (V.O.)
I love him, I want to spend the rest
of my life with him...
EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN
The Firemen watch a statue-like figure amidst the charred
ruins. The Batman.
RACHEL (V.O.)
When I told you that if Gotham no
longer needed Batman we could be
together, I meant it...
INT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Gordon surveys the wreckage of MCU. The bodies.
RACHEL (V.O.)
But I'm not sure the day will come...
EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN
Batman bends to the ground on one knee, his black glove
spread against the smoldering debris.
RACHEL (V.O.)
...when you no longer need Batman. I
hope it does, and if it does I will
be there...
95.
He spots something. DENT'S TWO-HEADED COIN. Blackened,
SCARRED. Batman turns it over. The other side is PRISTINE.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN
Alfred reads.
RACHEL (V.O.)
...but as your friend. I'm sorry to
let you down...
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAWN
Dent, heavily bandaged, hooked up to various machines.
Batman stands at the foot of his bed. Watching.
RACHEL (V.O.)
If you lose your faith in me, please
keep your faith in people...
BATMAN
I'm sorry, Harvey.
Batman puts DENT'S DAMAGED COIN on the bedside table.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
RACHEL (V.O.)
Love, now and always, Rachel.
Alfred finishes the letter. Tears in his eyes, he folds it
back into its envelope. Places it on the breakfast tray.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN
Alfred moves through the silent space, stepping past the cowl
and gauntlets lying on the cold marble. He approaches Wayne,
half-undressed, slumped in a chair watching Gotham.
ALFRED
I prepared a little breakfast.
Nothing. Alfred sets down the tray. The envelope is propped
against the silver teapot.
ALFRED
Very well.
WAYNE
Alfred?
ALFRED
Yes, Master Wayne?
Wayne turns, a desperate look in his eye.
96.
WAYNE
Did I bring this on us? On her? I
thought I would inspire good, not
madness-
ALFRED
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the face of Gotham's criminalsdidn't
you think there might be
casualties? Things were always going
to have to get worse before they got
better.
WAYNE
But Rachel, Alfred...
ALFRED
Rachel believed in what you stood
for. What we stand for.
Wayne looks up at Alfred. Alfred picks up the cowl.
ALFRED
Gotham needs you.
WAYNE
Gotham needs its hero. And I let the
Joker blow him half to hell-
ALFRED
Which is why for now, they'll have to
make do with you.
Alfred hands him the cowl. Wayne looks at him.
WAYNE
She was going to wait for me. Dent
doesn't know. He can never know...
Alfred glances at the envelope. Takes it off the tray.
WAYNE
What's that?
ALFRED
It can wait.
Alfred puts the envelope in his pocket.
WAYNE
That bandit, in the forest in
Burma... Did you catch him?
(Alfred nods)
How?
ALFRED
(uneasy)
We burned the forest down.
97.
EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY
A national guard helicopter ROARS over Gotham General.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
Dent. Bandaged. Sedated. Coming up for air. Sees
something on the table: his coin. He fumbles for it,
marvelling at its shiny face. Remembering.
INSERT CUT: RACHEL CATCHES THE COIN.
Dent turns the coin over. The other side is devastated. He
STARES at the scarred face. Starts ripping his bandages.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Alfred comes up to Wayne. Points him to the TV.
ALFRED
You need to see this.
On screen: Engel, in his studio, addresses the camera.
ENGEL
...he's a credible source- an A and M
lawyer for a prestigious consultancy.
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right
thing...
The shot cuts to REESE, nodding.
ENGEL
Now he's taking matters into his own
hands. We'll be live at five with
the true identity of the Batman, stay
with us...
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon ENTERS. Dent STARES to one side. He looks normal.
GORDON
I'm sorry about Rachel.
(nothing)
The Doctor says you're in agonizing
pain but you won't accept medication.
That you're refusing skin grafts-
DENT
Remember the name you all had for me
when I was at Internal Affairs? What
was it, Gordon?
GORDON
Harvey, I can't-
98.
DENT
SAY IT!
Dent's anger makes Gordon flinch. He looks away. Ashamed.
GORDON
(small)
Two-face. Harvey two-face.
Dent turns to face Gordon- the left side of Dent's face is
DESTROYED- skin blackened and shriveled. Molars visible.
The eye a ball and socket. Dent manages a small smile with
the good side of his face.
DENT
Why should I hide who I am?
GORDON
I... I know you tried to warn me.
I'm sorry. Wuertz picked you up- was
he working for them?
(nothing)
Do you know who picked up Rachel?
(nothing)
Harvey, I need to know which of my
men I can trust.
Dent looks at Gordon. Cold.
DENT
Why would you listen to me now?
GORDON
I'm sorry, Harvey.
DENT
No. No you're not. Not yet.
Gordon takes a last look at Dent. Then leaves.
INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon steps out. Someone is there. Maroni. On crutches.
Gordon stares at him. Cold. Maroni shifts, awkward.
MARONI
This craziness. This is too much.
GORDON
You should have thought of that
before you let the clown out of the
box.
MARONI
You want him, I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.
99.

The Chechen gets out of his SUV. Looks at a RUSTED HULK.
The Chechen, bodyguards, and dogs, head up the gangplank.
INT. RUSTED HULK -- CONTINUOUS
They pass into a huge hold. In the middle: A BILLION
DOLLARS. The pile is thirty feet high. Standing on top- the
Joker. At his feet, bound, is Lau. The Chechen laughs.
CHECHEN
Like I say- not so crazy as you look.
The Joker jumps from the top, slides down the pile.
THE JOKER
I told you- I'm a man of my word.
(looks around)
Where's the Italian?
The Chechen shrugs. Pulls out a cigar. Lights it.
CHECHEN
More for us. What you do with all
your money, Mr.Joker?
The Joker GRABS a can of GASOLINE from his thug.
THE JOKER
I'm a man of simple tastes. I like
gunpowder. Dynamite...
He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money.
THE JOKER
...gasoline...
The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards. The Joker turns. JABS
his gun in the Chechen's face. The Chechen's bodyguards
REACT. The Joker's men DRAW on them.
THE JOKER
And you know what they have in
common? They're cheap.
CHECHEN
You said you were a man of your word.
The Joker PLUCKS the cigar from the Chechen's lips.
THE JOKER
I am.
The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile.
THE JOKER
I'm only burning my half.
100.
The Chechen watches the money catch fire.
THE JOKER
All you care about is money. This
city deserves a better class of
criminal, and I'm going to give it to
them. This is my town now. Tell
your men they work for me.
The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs. They GROWL.
CHECHEN
They won't work for a freak.
The Joker takes out a knife. Tosses it to his man.
THE JOKER
Cut him up and offer him to his
little Princes. Let's show him just
how loyal a hungry dog is.
The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen.
THE JOKER
It's not about money. It's about
sending a message...
The Joker watches the towering FLAMES. Lau screams.
THE JOKER
Everything. Burns.
The Joker pulls out a phone...
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY
Reese has a confident air. Engel is taking calls.
CALLER 1 (O.S.)
I wanna how much they're gonna pay
you to say who Batman really is.
REESE
That's simply not why I'm doing this.
ENGEL
Caller, you're on the air.
CALLER 2 (O.S.)
Harvey dent didn't want us to give in
to this maniac- you think you know
better than him?
ENGEL
Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want
Batman to give himself up, is this
the right thing to do?
101.
REESE
If we could talk to Dent now he might
feel differently-
ENGEL
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows we need him, now. Let's
take another call-
OLD LADY (O.S.)
Mr.Reese, what's more valuable: one
life, or a hundred?
REESE
I guess it would depend on the life.
OLD LADY (O.S.)
OK. Let's say it's your life. Is it
worth more than the lives of several
hundred others?
REESE
Of course not.
OLD LADY (O.S.)
I'm glad you feel that way. Because
I've put a bomb in one of the city's
hospitals. It's going off in sixty
minutes unless someone kills you.
ENGEL
Who is this?
OLD (O.S.)
Just a concerned citizen-
(drops pitch to the
JOKER'S VOICE)
-and regular guy...
INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon and his men are gearing up to take down the Joker. A
Detective turns up the TV in the bullpen-
THE JOKER (O.S.)
I had a vision. Of a world without
Batman. The mob ground out a little
profit and the police tried to shut
them down, one block at a time...
and it was so... boring. I've had a
change of heart. I don't want
Mr.Reese spoiling everything, but why
should I have all the fun? Let's
give someone else a chance...
Reese looks around, twitching. Sweating.
102.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in sixty
minutes, then I blow up a hospital.
Of course, you could always kill
yourself, Mr.Reese. But that would
be the noble thing to do. And you're
a lawyer.
The line rings off. Engel is speechless.
Gordon turns to the uniform COPS.
GORDON
Call in every officer- tell them to
head to their nearest hospital and
start evac and search. Call the
transit authority, school board,
prisons- get every available bus down
to a hospital- the priority is Gotham
General- wheel everybody out of that
place right now- my hunch is that's
where the bomb is.
DETECTIVE MURPHY
Why?
GORDON
That's where Harvey Dent is.
The Uniforms SPRINT off. Gordon turns to his Detectives.
UNIFORMED COP
Where are we going, sir?
On screen: Reese is a deer in the headlights.
GORDON
To get Reese.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Wayne and Alfred move to the elevator.
WAYNE
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.
ALFRED
Looking for?
WAYNE
Hospital admissions.
ALFRED
Will you be taking the batpod, sir?
103.
WAYNE
In the middle of the day? Not very
subtle, Alfred.
ALFRED
The Lamborghini then.
(watches Wayne go)
Much more subtle.
EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- DAY
Wayne's Lamborghini TEARS through downtown.
INT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
CHAOS. PATIENTS and STAFF running around. COPS and TRAFFIC
WARDENS try to manage the evacuation. The COPS stationed
outside Dent's room, look around, unsure-
NURSE
Sir, are you going to help?!
Two Cops move to help wheel gurneys around the corner.
INT. LOBBY, TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY
Gordon and his men escort Reese out of the elevator- Engel
follows with a camera crew. As they approach the glass doors
Gordon looks out at an angry crowd.
ENGEL
Commissioner?! You really think
someone would try to-
Gordon SPOTS an OLD MAN raising a PISTOL- Gordon THROWS Reese
to the ground as SHOTS SHATTER the laminated glass of the
lobby. The Crowd SURGES in all directions-
GORDON
Get the cars around back!
Gordon hauls Reese to the stairwell.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne SLOWS past the chaos outside the television station.
WAYNE
I saw O'Brien and Richards...
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS
Alfred types at the computer station.
ALFRED
Nothing on them. No immediate family
members admitted to a Gotham
hospital.
104.
INT. STAIRWELL, TELEVISION STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon pulls the shaken Reese down the stairs...
REESE
(shaken)
They're trying to kill me.
...and into a police VAN...
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon throws Reese in the back. Smiles.
GORDON
Well, maybe Batman will save you.
The van PEELS out. Heads onto the streets.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
Cops load patients onto BUSES. A TV van pulls up, Engel and
his Cameraman jump out. One of Dent's guards, POLK, looks
into a SCHOOL BUS. Turns to the Cop loading it.
POLK
Okay, don't put anyone else on.
(gets on radio)
Davis, I got space, bring him out.
(no answer)
Davis?
Polk heads back towards the hospital, against the flow.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne trails the police van from a distance.
WAYNE
I saw Burns and Zachary... and a
patrolman I don't know.
ALFRED
Burns is clean... Zachary...
WAYNE
There's at least one I don't knowsend
the information to Gordon-
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon's phone BEEPS. He looks at a text: WATCH OUT. COPS
WITH RELATIVES IN GOTHAM HOSPITALS- BURKE, RAMIREZ, TILL...
INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Polk enters the room. No Davis. Just a REDHEADED NURSE,
back towards him, reading Dent's chart.
105.
POLK
Ma'am, we're going to have to move
him, now.
(nothing)
Ma'am?
The Redhead TURNS- it is the Joker, silenced pistol in hand.
He FIRES.
EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
The Lamborghini zips around a car to get closer to the van.
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon is reading his phone: ERIKSON, BERG. Gordon looks up
sharply. Considers the uniformed cop nervously fingering his
shotgun.
GORDON
Berg, isn't it?
The young cop, BERG, looks up. Sweating.
BERG
Commissioner?
GORDON
You okay, son?
Berg nods. Looks at his watch.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
The Joker draws closer to Dent's bed. Dent STRAINS at the
leather cuffs binding him to the bed.
THE JOKER
I don't want there to be any hard
feelings between us, Harvey.
The Joker loosens Dent's restraints.
THE JOKER
When you and Rachel were being
abducted I was sitting in Gordon's
cage. I didn't rig those charges-
DENT
Your men. Your plan.
THE JOKER
Do I really look like a guy with a
plan, Harvey? I don't have a
plan...The mob has plans, the cops
have plans. You know what I am,
Harvey?
106.
Dent's hand is TREMBLING.
THE JOKER
I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't
know what to do with one if I caught
it. I just do things. I'm just the
wrench in the gears. I hate plans.
Yours, theirs, everyone's. Maroni
has plans. Gordon has plans.
Schemers trying to control their
worlds. I'm not a schemer, I show
the schemers how pathetic their
attempts to control things really
are. So when I say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal, you
know I'm telling the truth...
Hands him the pistol. Dent holds it to the Joker's head.
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne ROARS past a line of traffic to settle in a few cars
back from the police van, sitting at a red light.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne studies the intersection- spots a PICKUP jostling for
position on the cross street.
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches Berg, mentally tracing the trajectory of his
shotgun barrel as Berg fiddles with his gun. Gordon starts
trying to subtly unholster his own weapon.
GORDON
I'm gonna need your weapon, son.
Berg looks at Gordon.
BERG
What?
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne watches the driver of the pickup staring intently at
the police van. Lining it up.
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Reese looks from Berg to Gordon. Berg looks at Gordon,
trembling, the barrel of his gun inching lower in the car.
BERG
Why? Because my wife's in hospital?
GORDON
Yeah. That would be why.
107.
INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker leans in, pressing his head to the gun's barrel.
THE JOKER
It's the schemers who put you where
you are. You were a schemer. You
had plans. Look where it got you. I
just did what I do best- I took your
plan, and I turned it on itself.
Look what I've done to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of
bullets. Nobody panics when the
expected people get killed. Nobody
panics when things go according to
plan, even if the plan is horrifying.
If I tell the press that tomorrow a
gangbanger will get shot, or a
truckload of soldiers will be blown
up, nobody panics. Because it's all
part of the plan. But when I say
that one little old mayor will die,
everybody loses their minds!
Introduce a little anarchy, you upset
the established order and everything
becomes chaos. I'm an agent of
chaos. And you know the thing about
chaos, Harvey?
Dent looks into the Joker's eyes. Finding meaning.
THE JOKER
It's fair.
Dent looks down at the coin in his hands. Turns it over,
feels it's comforting weight. Shows the Joker the good side.
DENT
You live.
He turns the coin over. The flip side is deeply SCARRED.
DENT
You die.
The Joker looks at the coin. Looks at Dent, admiringly.
THE JOKER
Now you're talking.
Dent FLICKS the coin into the air. Catches it. Looks.
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
The light turns GREEN. The police van pulls into the
intersection- the pickup GUNS IT, RACING AT IT...
108.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne FLOORS it, YANKS the wheel to pull up onto the sidewalk-
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Berg licks his lips, nervous.
BERG
Mr.Reese?
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
The pickup BARRELS at the van, FULL TILT- at the last second
Wayne's Lamborghini SLIPS alongside the van- the pickup
SMASHES INTO THE LAMBORGHINIINT.
POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
As the van JOLTS with the impact Gordon LEAPS forward,
PUSHING UP Berg's shotgun barrel, which FIRES into the roof-
Gordon SMASHES Berg on the head with his sidearm.
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon's men pull the pickup driver from his cab- Gordon
crouches down to the Lamborghini wreck to help pull Wayne
from the car. Gordon recognizes him as he pulls him free.
GORDON
You okay, Mr.Wayne?
Wayne looks at him, woozy. Sits on the curb.
WAYNE
Call me Bruce. I think so.
GORDON
That was a brave thing, you did.
WAYNE
Trying to catch the light?
GORDON
You weren't protecting the van?
Wayne turns- sees the police van as if for the first time.
Reese steps down, dazed.
WAYNE
Why? Who's in it?
Reese locks eyes with Wayne. Nods. Gordon sizes up Bruce
Wayne and his crushed sports car.
GORDON
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr.Wayne?
109.
WAYNE
(shrugs)
It can get a little intense. Think I
should go to hospital?
GORDON
Not today, I wouldn't.
INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building.
As he walks he pulls a DETONATOR from his pocket. Strolling
along he PUSHES THE BUTTON... STAGGERED EXPLOSIONS BURST INTO
THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HIM LIKE DEMOLITION BLASTS... the Joker
just walks out the door...
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker STROLLS down the steps- WINDOWS BLOW OUT IN SERIESPeople
DIVE for cover- Engel PILES into a school bus-
The Joker walks across the parking lot- THE BUILDING
COLLAPSING BEHIND HIM...
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon hears the EXPLOSION.
GORDON
Gotham general...
(grabs his phone)
Did you get Dent out?
COP (O.S.)
I think so-
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Cop cowers as DEBRIS and SMOKE BLAST across the street-
INT. SCHOOL BUS -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker gets onto the bus. Nods at his man at the wheel.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
All eyes are on the collapsed building. One school bus pulls
out from the line of other buses. Heads down the street.
INT. BAR, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- DAY
An empty neighborhood dive, the local DRUNK passed out at the
bar, BARTENDER, watching BREAKING NEWS on the TV.
BARTENDER
Sweet Jesus. D'you see this, Mike?
They blew up a hospital...
110.
Detective Wuertz, at a booth looks up at the TV, bored.
BARTENDER
Shouldn't you be out there, you know,
doing something?
WUERTZ
It's my day off.
The Bartender shuts the register.
BARTENDER
I gotta take a leak, keep an eye on
things, will ya?
The Bartender steps out. The back door OPENS again.
WUERTZ
What? You need me to shake it for-
He TRAILS off as someone sticks a gun in his face: Harvey
Dent. Standing in shadow. He sits.
DENT
Hello.
WUERTZ
Dent, I thought you was...dead...
Dent leans into the light. The left side of his face is
HIDEOUSLY BURNED, cheek gone, blackened teeth and gums.
DENT
Half.
Dent picks up Wuertz's drink. Takes a SIP. Wuertz watches
the bare muscles RETRACT as Dent SWALLOWS.
DENT
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
WUERTZ
It must've been Maroni's men-
Dent SLAMS the glass back on the table- Wuertz FLINCHES.
DENT
You, of all people, are gonna protect
the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
WUERTZ
I don't know- he'd never tell me.
(stares at Dent)
I swear to God, I didn't know what
they were gonna do to you-
111.
DENT
Funny, I don't know what's going to
happen to you, either.
Dent pulls his coin from his pocket. FLIPS it. Wuertz
watches it SPIN. It lands on the table. Scarred side up.
The drunk at the bar STIRS at the GUNSHOT.
EXT. GOTHAM GENERAL -- DAY
Gordon, manic, surveys the scene with a Cop-
GORDON
You must know how many were insideyou've
got patient lists, roll calls-
COP
Sir! Sir. Take a look at what we're
dealing with. Cops, National Guard-
(gestures at buses)
We're showing 50 missing- but that
building was clear. These buses are
heading off to other hospitals- my
guess is we missed one.
GORDON
Yeah? What's your guess about where
Harvey Dent is?
The cop says nothing.
GORDON
Keep looking. Keep it to yourself.
INT. FOX'S OFFICE WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY
Fox is watching the news. His intercom buzzes.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mr.Fox? Security is showing a breakin
at the R and D department.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
Fox watches two security men force the door. He enters
alone.
INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
Fox enters the dimly-lit room. At one end is an
extraordinary array of thousands of tiny monitors. Fox
approaches, fascinated, as they quietly display architectural
patterns individually and in concert. The images become a
MAP.
BATMAN
Beautiful. Isn't it?
112.
Fox nods, staring at the monitors as Batman approaches.
FOX
Beautiful. Unethical. Dangerous.
You've turned every phone in the city
into a microphone...
Lucius presses a key. The BABBLE of a MILLION CONVERSATIONS
at once fills the room. Every cell phone in the city.
BATMAN
And high frequency
generator/receiver.
FOX
Like the phone I gave you in Hong
Kong. You took my sonar concept and
applied it to everybody's phone in
the City. With half the city feeding
you sonar you can image all of
Gotham.
(turns to Batman)
This is wrong.
BATMAN
I've got to find this man, Lucius.
FOX
But at what cost?
BATMAN
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one
person.
FOX
No one should have that kind of
power.
WAYNE
That's why I gave it to you. Only
you can use it.
Lucius looks at Batman. Hard.
FOX
Spying on thirty million people
wasn't in my job description.
Batman points to a TV screen. Fox turns. ON SCREEN: the
Joker shakes his head above a graphic "LATEST THREAT"...
THE JOKER
What does it take to make you people
want to join in..?
113.
EXT. SITUATION TENT AT GOTHAM GENERAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches a screen. Grave.
THE JOKER
You failed to kill the lawyer... I've
got to get you off the bench and into
the game. So, here it is...
INT. BAR, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
The bar, packed with business people watches the TV. SILENT.
THE JOKER
Come nightfall, this city is mine,
and anyone left here plays by my
rules. If you don't want to be in
the game, get out now.
Bar patrons start moving... The Joker reaches for the camera-
THE JOKER
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are
in for a surprise.
CUT TO STATIC. The bar patrons look around, confused.
INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Fox turns from the TV to look at Batman.
BATMAN
Trust me.
Fox stares at Batman.
BATMAN
This is the audio sample.
He plugs a USB dongle into the console. A sample of the
Joker's voice from the call-in news program plays.
BATMAN
If he talks within range of any phone
in the city, you'll be able to
triangulate his position.
Lucius toggles a menu. The city is an open book- People
working, eating, sleeping. Lucius shakes his head.
BATMAN
When you've finished, type your name
to switch it off.
FOX
I'll help you this one time...
Lucius sits at the console. Batman moves off-
114.
FOX
But consider this my resignation.
Batman turns. Fox looks at him, serious.
FOX
As long as this machine is at Wayne
Industries, I won't be.
EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DUSK
Gothamites POUR out of the city, on foot and by car... the
BRIDGES and TUNNELS are deserted, but for BOMB SQUAD search
teams.
INT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon briefs the Mayor.
GORDON
My officers are going over every inch
of the tunnels and bridges, but with
the Joker's threat they're not and
option.
MAYOR
Land routes East?
GORDON
Backed up for hours. Which leaves
the ferries with thirty thousand
waiting to board. Plus, corrections
are at capacity, so I want to use a
ferry to take some prisoners off the
island.
MAYOR
The men you and Dent put away? Those
aren't people I'm worried about.
GORDON
You should be- they're the people you
least want to be stuck with in an
emergency. Whatever the Joker's
planning, it's a good bet that
Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
I want 'em out of here.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK
At the ferry terminal, National Guardsman watch over the
THIRTY THOUSAND jostling, scared people waiting to board the
two MASSIVE FERRIES to Seven Sisters. Grumbles turn to YELLS
as 800 PRISONERS are loaded onto a ferry by shotgun-toting
CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.
115.
CIVILIAN
That ain't right! We should be on
that boat.
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
You want to ride across with them, be
my guest.
EXT. BROWNSTONE -- DUSK
Maroni climbs into the back of a limo.
INT. LIMO -- DUSK
Maroni settles back into his seat. The car pulls away.
MARONI
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
DENT
Going to join your wife?
Maroni STARTS. Someone is in here with him. Harvey Dent-
Two Face- leans forward, clutching a pistol.
DENT
You love her?
MARONI
Yes.
DENT
Can you imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?
MARONI
Take it up with the Joker. He killed
your woman. Made you... like this...
DENT
The Joker's just a mad dog. I want
whoever let him off the leash.
Maroni looks at Dent. Worried.
DENT
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?
Who picked up Rachel? It must've
been someone she trusted.
MARONI
If I tell you, will you let me go?
DENT
It can't hurt your chances.
116.
MARONI
It was Ramirez.
Pulls out his coin. Dent cocks the pistol...
MARONI
But you said-
DENT
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
Dent FLIPS it. Looks: good side. He shrugs.
DENT
Lucky guy.
Maroni looks confused. Dent FLIPS the coin again. Looks
down at the coin. Shakes his head.
DENT
But he's not.
MARONI
Who?
Dent smiles. PUTS HIS SEAT BELT ON.
DENT
Your driver.
Dent presses the barrel of the revolver behind the shadow of
the driver. Maroni LUNGES, SCREAMING. Dent FIRES.
EXT. BRIDGE -- DUSK
The Limo SWERVES off of the bridge, SOARS out over the canal,
and PANCAKES into the RETAINING WALL.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK
CIVILIANS CRAM their way onto one ferry. Finally, the
COMMANDER of the National Guard unit SIGNALS to his men to
STOP BOARDING and CAST OFF.
The two FERRIES set off across the river, heading for the
lights of the distant shore of the mainland.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The FIRST MATE looks out the window, at the second ferry. It
is DEAD in the WATER. He turns to the PILOT [PRISON FERRY].
FIRST MATE
They've lost their engines.
117.
PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
Get on the radio and tell 'em we'll
come back for them once we dump these
scumbags-
Suddenly, the control panel FLICKERS and DIES.
PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
Get down to the engine room.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The First Mate skirts around the PRISONERS and CORRECTIONS
OFFICERS...
INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The First Mate opens the door to the engine room. STOPS.
HUNDREDS OF BARRELS OF DIESEL FUEL. And a small, wrapped
PRESENT, topped with a BOW.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Pilot [Prison Ferry] is holding the small present. His
radio CRACKLES.
PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY] (O.S.)
Same thing over here- enough diesel
to blow us sky high. And a present.
EXT. ELEVATED ROADWAY, DOWTOWN GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS
Batman sits on the bat-pod, cape blowing. Listening.
BATMAN
Fox? There's something going on on
the ferries...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
As cold scared Families watch, the NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
UNWRAPS that ferry's present. Inside, he finds a crude
REMOTE DETONATOR.
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
Why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?
Up in the wiring at the ceiling, a CELL PHONE taped in to the
P.A. rings and answers.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
Tonight, you're all going to be part
of a social experiment.
ON BOTH FERRIES: CIVILIANS, PRISONERS, CREW, AND NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN ALL LISTEN AS THE JOKER'S VOICE RINGS OUT.
118.
INT. LAB, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- NIGHT
Lucius Fox looks up as the console CHIMES.
FOX
I'm zeroing in.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
Through the magic of diesel fuel and
ammonium nitrate, I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky high. Anyone
attempts to get off their boat, you
all die...
FOX
His voice is on the ferry, but that's
not the source...
EXT. ROOFTOPS ABOVE GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Batman looks out, across the entire city skyline.
BATMAN
Do you have a location on the Joker?
FOX
It's west...
Batman FIRES UP the bat-pod- his cape SHRINKS into its pack
form as he PEELS OUT, ROARING into the night.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
But we're going to make things a
little more interesting than that.
Tonight, we're going to learn a
little bit about ourselves...
INT. GORDON HOME -- CONTINUOUS
Barbara Gordon answers the phone.
RAMIREZ (O.S.)
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez-
BARBARA
Hi, Anna-
RAMIREZ (O.S.)
Listen carefully, there's no time.
Jim needs you to pack up and get the
kids in the car right away.
BARBARA
But the units outside-
119.
RAMIREZ (O.S.)
Barbara, those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them as soon
as possible. I'll call them off for
10 minutes, you'll have to move fast-
BARBARA
But where-
RAMIREZ (O.S.)
I'm going to give you an address- Jim
will meet you there...
EXT. MCU -- CONTINUOUS
Ramirez is holding the phone.
RAMIREZ
250, 52nd street. Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.
Dent is holding a gun at Ramirez's head. She hangs up.
DENT
She believe you?
Ramirez nods.
DENT
She trusts you. Just like Rachel
did.
RAMIREZ
I didn't know-
DENT
'What they were gonna do'? You're
the second cop to say that to me.
What, exactly, did you think they
were going to do?
RAMIREZ
I'm sorry- they got me early on. My
mother's medical bills and my-
DENT
Don't!
Dent FLIPS his coin.
RAMIREZ
I took a little from them- once
they've got you, they keep you. I'm
sorry.
Dent looks at his coin. Good side.
120.
DENT
Live to fight another day, officer.
Dent CRACKS her on the head with his gun.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Pilot [Prison Ferry] tries the radio. It's DEAD.
PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
He killed the radio.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
There's no need for all of you to
die. That would be a waste. So I've
left you both a little present.
EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
The Joker stares out over the harbor, at the ferries.
Talking into a cell phone. Holding a detonator, with TWO
BUTTONS.
THE JOKER
Each of you has a remote to blow up
the other boat.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Prisoners and Corrections Officers listen. Appalled.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
At midnight, I blow you all up. If,
however, one of you presses the
button, I'll let that boat live. You
choose. So who's it going to be-
Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag
collection... or the sweet innocent
civilians?
(beat)
Oh, and you might want to decide
quickly, because the people on the
other boat may not be quite so noble.
The Joker HANGS UP. The Pilot [Prisoner Ferry] looks down at
the remote in his hands. Prisoners begin YELLING and
PUSHING. The WARDEN takes the remote from the Pilot- COCKS
his shotgun. His men level their weapons at the crowd.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon looks out at the ferries. His phone rings.
BATMAN
I have the Joker's location-
121.
EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Batman ROARS along on the bat-pod.
BATMAN

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
The National Guard Commander is holding the remote. Several
passengers take a step towards him. He PULLS his weapon.
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
Stay back.
A BUSINESSMAN clutching his briefcase speaks up.
BUSINESSMAN
Who are you to decide? We ought to
talk it over, at least.
Other passengers agree. A MOTHER with two KIDS speaks up.
MOTHER
We don't all have to die. Why should
my babies die? Those men had their
chance-
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
We're not talking about this...
PASSENGER 1
They're talking over the same exact
thing on the other boat.
PASSENGER 2
If they're even bothering to talk.
Let's put it to a vote.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
As the Prisoners grow angrier, a CORRECTIONS OFFICER FIRES
his shotgun into the air. The Prisoners back off. Slightly.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
A GUARDSMAN on this boat passes around a hat. People drop
CHITS into it. Passengers filling out chits eye each other.
People on their phones say goodbye to loved ones.
The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks out across the water to the
other Ferry. Looks up at the clock. Ten to midnight...
STARES down at his blank chit.

Gordon and his SWAT team leaders set up SNIPER and SCOPE

INT. GARAGE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
A SWAT stands beside the empty school bus.
SWAT
We've found our missing bus.
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon looks at the SWAT LEADER.
GORDON
Then we have a hostage situation.
They look across at the large windows of the Prewitt
Building. The Joker's men, in crude, homemade CLOWN MASKS
are clearly visible, automatic weapons in hand.
SWAT SNIPER
I got hostages!
They look through his scope. Crouched deeper in the room,
PATIENTS, DOCTORS, and NURSES, huddled.
GORDON
It's a shooting gallery. Why'd he
choose a spot with such big windows?
BATMAN
He likes the view.
Batman gestures towards the view of the ferries.
SWAT LEADER
We have clear shots on five clowns.
Snipers take them out, smash the
windows- a team rappels in, a team
moves in by the stairwells. 2 or 3
or three casualties, max.
GORDON
(barely hesitates)
Let's do it.
BATMAN
It's not that simple. With the
Joker, it never is.
GORDON
What's simple, is that every second
we don't take him, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing
each other up!
123.
BATMAN
That won't happen.
GORDON
Then he'll blow them both up!
There's no time- we have to go in now-
BATMAN
There's always a catch with him-
GORDON
That's why we can't wait- we can't
play his games-
Batman turns.
BATMAN
I need five minutes. Alone-
GORDON
No. There's no time. We have clear
shots.
Gordon pulls his gun. Batman turns back. The SWATS watch.
GORDON
Dent's in there with them. We have
to save Dent! I have to save Dent!
(to SWAT Leader)
Get ready-
Batman LEAPS from the building, OPENS his cape- SOARS across
the gulf between the two buildings- Gordon puts his weapon
away. Curses softly. Turns to the SWAT leader.
GORDON
Two minutes. Then you breach.

EXT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
SMOKED GLASS EYEPIECES slip down over Batman's eye holes.
Batman's SONAR P.O.V.: the layers of the building dissolve,
levels of TRANSPARENCY PULSING rhythmically... Batman can see
the people inside the building...
INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
The Joker is standing by the window, looking out at his
handiwork. The Chechen's DOGS start BARKING. He SMILES.
EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
Batman reaches into his utility belt, SPRAYS PLASTIC onto the
glass- lets it harden- PUNCHES the window-which BREAKS
QUIETLY as the pieces stick to the laminate- he slips inside-

Batman's eyes glow white as he uses his sonar to look THROUGH

Hello, Jim.
GORDON
Harvey? What the hell's going on?
DENT (O.S.)
You're about to know what my
suffering is really like...
Gordon looks across at the Prewitt penthouse...
GORDON (O.S.)
Where are you? Where's my family?!
DENT
Where my family died.
Click. Gordon looks at the SWAT leader. Pale.
125.
SWAT LEADER
Red Team. Go!
Gordon moves to the door off the roof.
INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
Batman GRABS the Armed Clown, drops him, silently. He goes
to disarm him- THE WEAPON IS DUCT-TAPED TO THE CLOWN'S HANDS.
Batman RIPS off the clown mask:
STARING, FRIGHTENED EYES- MOUTH DUCT-TAPED SHUT... it's
ENGEL.
Batman looks up: Four more clowns line the windows, weapons
duct-taped to their hands. On SONAR: he looks into where the
hostages are crouched... the "PATIENTS" and "DOCTORS" are
carrying weapons- these are the Joker's men... Above them
SWATS RAPPEL FROM THE ROOFTOP. ~In the stairwells, two more
teams prepping.

Don't. Move.
Engel nods, terrified.

A SWAT Sniper zeroes in on a clown- the clown DISAPPEARS- the
Sniper looks up, confused-

Batman yanks the clown along the floor using his grapple gunthe
clown takes down the two next to him- Batman leaps for

takes out the SWATS with fists and BATARANGSThe
last SWAT aims at BATMAN- behind him a "DOCTOR" raises a
shotgun... behind the "Doctor" Batman can see through the
wall at SWATS preparing to breach... Batman VAULTS over the
SWAT into a two-foot kick into the "Doctor's" chest-
INT. STAIRWELL, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
The Swats BLAST OUT THE WALL- the team leader steps up to the
hole... the BAT-GRAPPLE FIRES out-lodging in his kevlar
vest... he is YANKED, SCREAMING, through the door. The rest
of his team look at each other. Steel themselves. Move in
through the hole...
INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
As the SWATS race in they find Engel, terrified, next to a
pile of unconscious "hostages", and their team leader, one
end of an absailing rope tied around his waist. Batman is on
them, weaving KICKING, PUNCHING, and, with one hand, clipping
carabinners looped to the absailing rope onto their webbing
of vests.
Batman steps back- picks up the team leader- SWAT weapons aim
at him- he hurls the Team Leader out the window... the SWATS
watch him go... the rope pays out... one by one they are
YANKED out of the window...
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
A SNIPER watches through his scope as the six man SWAT team
soars out of the window and drops. The line snaps taut and
they hang, like a mountaineering team in crisis. Batman,
crouched in the broken window, secures the line.
SNIPER
What the hell's he doing?
Batman looks right at the sniper- Raises his grapple gun-
BAM. The bat grapple smashes into the Sniper's scope- the
rifle is YANKED out of his hands.
INT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
Batman races past a dazed Engel...
ENGEL
(pathetic)
Thanks.
...into the main office. The Joker is there.

You came. I'm touched.
BATMAN
Where's the detonator?
The Dogs LEAP at Batman- SMASH him to the ground...

The Warden and his men look at each other. At the clock.
INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
Batman WRESTLES with the Rotweilers- a blinding mass of
Batman, black fur and bared teeth-
The Joker POPS a switchblade. Moves in to the mass- Batman
KICKS OFF the last of the dogs- the Joker JABS his knife into
Batman's RIBSTHE
JOKER
All the old familiar places.
Batman recoils in pain. The Joker BUTTS him- KNEES him-
ENERGY explodes from his lean frame- he KICKS the injured
Batman back towards the glass...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks at the remote in his hands.
PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]
I voted for it. Same as most of you.
Doesn't seem right that we should all
die...
Someone calls out from the back.
128.
PASSENGER 3
So do it!
PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]
I didn't say I'd do it. Don't
forget. We're still here. Which
means they haven't killed us, yet,
either.
He sets the remote down on a bench in the front of the
lounge. The other passengers and guardsmen stare at it...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
A HUGE, TATTOOED PRISONER pushes his way to the front. He
walks towards the Warden, who is sweating, looking at the
remote.
TATTOOED PRISONER
You don't wanna die. But you don't
know how to take a life. Give it to
me.
The Warden looks at the remote. At the clock.
TATTOOED PRISONER
These men will kill you and take it,
anyway. Give it to me, you can tell
people I took it by force... give it
to me and I'll do what you should
have done ten minutes ago.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
Everyone stares at the remote. One minute left. The
Businessman stands. Walks over and picks it up.
BUSINESSMAN
No one wants to get their hands
dirty. Fine. I'll do it. Those men
on that boat made their choices.
They chose to murder and steal. It
makes no sense for us to die, too.
He looks at the other passengers. No one makes eye contact.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Warden slowly hands him the REMOTE. The Prisoner looks
at it. He looks the Warden in the eye...
Then TOSSES the remote out the window.
Warden, prisoners and officers are stunned.

Batman FLIES backwards THROUGH THE WINDOW- glass flying- the
Joker KICKS out a wooden brace holding up the STEEL FRAMEBatman's
arms fly up as it comes crashing down onto his necksaved
by his protective gauntlets. Batman GRUNTS as the
Joker STEPS onto the steel beam...
THE JOKER
If we don't stop fighting, we're
going to miss the fireworks.
BATMAN
There won't be any fireworks.
Batman STRUGGLES to keep the beam from CRUSHING his neck...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Businessman stares at the remote in his hands. Finally,
he puts it down. Sits down. Waits to die.
The clock strikes MIDNIGHT.
EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
Batman indicates the clock... twelve o'clock.
BATMAN
What were you hoping to prove? That
deep down, we're all as ugly as you?
The Joker looks at the clock...
INT. BOTH FERRIES -- CONTINUOUS
The Passengers brace. Look at the clock. Confused...
INT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
The smile disappears from the Joker's face.
BATMAN
You're alone.
The Joker CROUCHES down, hovering above Batman's face and
arms. Shows him the remote.
THE JOKER
Can't rely on anyone these days.
The Joker ARMS the remote...
THE JOKER
Have to do everything yourself. I
always have- and it's not always
easy...
130.
(MORE)
(smiles, remembering)
You know how I got these scars?
Batman looks up at him.
BATMAN
No. But I know how you get these-
Batman's SCALLOP BLADES FIRE OUT OF HIS GAUNTLET, nailing the
Joker in the chest and arm- he STAGGERS back- Batman, freed,
leaps forward- KICKS HIM OVER THE EDGE- GRABS the remote-
The Joker GIGGLES as he FALLS, enjoying the ride. Something
SLAMS into his leg, and he JERKS to a stop- BATMAN'S GRAPPLE.
The Joker HOLLERS in pain as Batman HAULS him up.
THE JOKER
Just couldn't let me go, could you?
I guess this is what happens when an
unstoppable force meets an immovable
object. You truly are incorruptible,
aren't you?
Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN. The Joker is LAUGHING.
THE JOKER
You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of selfrighteousness...
and I won't kill you
because you're too much fun. We're
going to do this forever.
BATMAN
You'll be in a padded cell, forever.
THE JOKER
Maybe we can share it. They'll need
to double up, the rate this city's
inhabitants are losing their minds...
BATMAN
This city just showed you it's full
of people ready to believe in good.
The Joker looks up at him. A twinkle in his eye.
THE JOKER
Till their spirit breaks completely.
Until they find out what I did with
the best of them. Until they get a
good look at the real Harvey Dent,
and all the heroic things he's done.
(indicates ferry)
Then those criminals will be straight
back onto the streets and Gotham will
understand the true nature of
heroism.

THE JOKER (cont'd)
(MORE)
You didn't think I'd risk losing the
battle for the soul of Gotham in a
fist fight with you? You've got to
have an ace in the hole. Mine's
Harvey.
Batman hauls the Joker up, nose to nose.
BATMAN
What did you do?
THE JOKER
I took Gotham's white knight. And I
brought him down to my level. It
wasn't hard- madness is like gravity.
All it takes is a little push.
Joker laughs. Batman leaves him to the SWATS.
BATMAN
Lucius. Find Harvey Dent.
EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT
Gordon gets out of his car, gun drawn. Makes his way into
the blackened wreck of a building...
INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT
Gordon peers into the darkness.
GORDON
Dent?
No reply. Gordon makes his way deeper. Up the stairs.
INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Gordon spots Barbara and their two children huddled together.
He moves towards them- Barbara is shaking her head-
WHAM! Dent cracks Gordon over the head with his gun. Dent
disarms Gordon, rolls him over. He turns to look at the
ENORMOUS hole in the floor. From this side, in the
moonlight, Dent looks completely normal.
DENT
This is where they brought her,
Gordon. After your people handed her
over. This is where they bound her.
This is where she suffered. This is
where she died.
GORDON
I know. I was here. Trying to save
her.
Dent TURNS, revealing his dark side.
132.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
DENT
But you didn't, did you?
GORDON
I couldn't.
DENT
Yes, you could.
DENT
If you'd listened to me- if you'd
stood up against corruption instead
of doing your deal with the devil.
GORDON
I was trying to fight the mob-
Dent MOVES towards Gordon.
DENT
You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you love most, wondering if
you're about to listen to them die?
You ever had to lie to that person?
Tell them it's going to be all right,
when you know it's not? Well, you're
about to find out what that feels
like. Then you'll be able to look me
in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
Dent turns- steps over to Barbara- puts the gun to her temple-
GORDON
Harvey. Put the gun down. You're
not going to hurt my family.
DENT
No, just the person you need most.
(cocks gun)
So is it your wife?
GORDON
Put the gun down.
Dent moves the gun to point at Gordon's little girl.
GORDON
Please, Harvey...
Dent moves to James Gordon. Brushes the hair out of the
boy's eyes with the muzzle. Gordon SNAPS.
GORDON
Goddamit. Stop pointing that gun at
my family, Dent.
133.
DENT
We have a winner.
Dent pulls the boy away from his mother.
BARBARA
No! Jim stop him! Don't let him!
Dent walks James past Gordon to the edge of the burnt floor.
He touches the raw wood at the edge of the floor.
GORDON
I'm sorry, Harvey. For everything.
But, please. Please don't hurt him.
SIRENS.
EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Cop cars descend on the warehouse.
INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Dent looks at Gordon, FURIOUS.
DENT
You brought your cops?
GORDON
All they know is there's a situation.
They don't know who, or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.
DENT
You think I want to escape?! There's
no escape from this-
Dent indicates his face. His suffering.
GORDON
No one needs to escape, because no
one's done anything wrong. And
nobody has to.
Dent chuckles. A macabre sight.
DENT
I've done plenty wrong, Gordon. Just
not quite enough. Yet.
Dent squeezes the gun a little tighter against the little
boy's neck. The boy WHIMPERS.
BATMAN
You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.
Dent turns. Batman steps from the shadows.
134.
DENT
It's not about what I want. It's
about what's fair.
(to Gordon and Batman)
You thought we could be decent men in
an indecent world. You thought we
could lead by example. You thought
the rules could be bent but not
break... you were wrong. The world
is cruel.
(shows his coin)
And the only morality in a cruel
world is chance. Unbiased.
Unprejudiced. Fair.
BATMAN
Nothing fair ever came out of the
barrel of a gun, Dent.
DENT
(shows the coin)
His boy's got the same chance she
had. Fifty-fifty.
Batman steps closer, desperate, trying to reach Dent.
BATMAN
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act. We
three. We knew the risks and we
acted as one. We are all responsible
for the consequences.
Dent looks at Batman. Pleading.
DENT
Then why was it only me who lost
everything?
Batman looks into Dent's eyes. Emotional.
BATMAN
It wasn't.
DENT
(furious)
The Joker chose me!
BATMAN
Because you were the best of us. He
wanted to prove that even someone as
good as you could fall.
DENT
(bitter)
And he was right.
135.
BATMAN
But your fooling yourself if you
think you're letting chance decide.
You're the one pointing the gun,
Harvey. So point it at the people
who were responsible. We all acted
as one. Gordon. Me. And you.
Dent is listening, the wheels in his deranged mind turning.
DENT
Fair enough.
Dent eases his grip on the boy.
DENT
You first.
He points the gun at Batman. FLIPS the coin. TAILS. He
SHOOTS. Batman COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching his gut.
DENT
My turn.
He points the gun at his own head. FLIPS the coin. HEADS.
He looks a little disappointed.
Finally, he points the gun back at Gordon's son.
DENT
Your turn, Gordon.
GORDON
You're right, Harvey. Rachel's death
was my fault. But punish me-
DENT
I'm about to. Tell your son it's
going to be all right, Gordon. Lie.
Like I lied.
Gordon looks up. Pained. Locks eyes with his son.
GORDON
It's going to be all right, son.
Dent FLIPS the coin. High. Dent's eyes FOLLOW the coin up-
Batman HURLS himself at Dent and the boy.
All three of them VANISH over the edge. A TERRIBLE CRASHthen
silence, but for the sound of DENT'S COIN, SPINNING on
the floor at the edge of the hole.
Gordon, horrified, RUNS to the edge- peers down-
Dent lies at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken. DEAD.
The coin stops spinning, GOOD SIDE UP.
136.
Gordon's son swings into view, HANGING from Batman, who is
holding onto a JOIST with all his strength...
Gordon reaches down to GRAB his son- HAULS him up...
Batman FALLS..., dropping and dropping, SMASHING THROUGH
protruding WOOD and PIPES... He lands HARD near Dent.
EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS

INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon races down the stairs. Rushes over to Batman.
JAMES
Dad, is he okay?
Gordon crouches at Batman's side. The Batman GRASPS Gordon's
arm. STAGGERS to his feet.
GORDON
Thank-you.
BATMAN
You don't have to-
GORDON
Yes, I do.
Gordon and Batman stare down at Dent's body. Grave.
GORDON
The Joker won.
Gordon stares down at SCARRED SIDE of Harvey Dent.
GORDON
Harvey's prosecution, everything he
fought for, everything Rachel died
for. Undone. Whatever chance Gotham
had of fixing itself... whatever
chance you gave us of fixing our
city... dies with Harvey's
reputation. We bet it all on him.
The Joker took the best of us and
tore him down. People will lose all
hope.
BATMAN
No. They won't.
(looks at Gordon)
They can never know what he did.
137.
GORDON
(incredulous)
Five dead? Two of them cops? We
can't sweep that under-
BATMAN
No. But the Joker cannot win.
Batman crouches to Dent's body.
BATMAN
Gotham needs its true hero.
Gently, he turns Dent's head so the good side of his face is
up. Gordon looks from Dent's face to Batman. Understanding.
GORDON
You? You can't-
BATMAN
Yes, I can.
Batman stands. Faces Gordon.
BATMAN
You either die a hero or live long
enough to see yourself become the
villain. I can do those things
because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I
killed those people. That's what I
can be.
GORDON
(angry)
No, you can't! You're not!
Batman hands Gordon his police radio.
BATMAN
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

A deck of cards, ar a bird...
INT. SCALA THEATRE, LONDON -- NIGHT
A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN,
his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air.
CUTTER (V.O.)
...or a man.
A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He
shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He show you this object, and pledges
to you its utter normality...
Bearbed Man and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant
down towards the stage...
2.
On which stands the magician, leaning on his cane, smiling.
This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is
a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Perhaps he asks you to inspect it...
Bearbed Man, FASCINATED, and other Volunteers look over
the vast machine. As angier GESTURES theatrically at the
various features of the metal and glass apparatus.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...to see that it is indeed real...
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers off the stage, Bearded
Man slips through the gap at the side of the curtains-
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...unaltered...
INT. STAGE THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
-looks around, DISORIENTED, then darts for some stairs leagind
below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND.
CUTTER (V.O.)
...normal.
STAGEHAND
Where'd you think you're going?!
CUTTER (V.O.)
But, of course, it probably isn't...
Bearded Man pulls off his beard, revealing the face of ALFRED
BORDEN, mid 30's.
BEARDED MAN
I'm part of the act, you fool!
The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden
RACES down below the stage. Cutter approaches the Stagehand.
CUTTER
Who was that?
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
As the machine GROANS to life. SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier
gazes at it, forgettig his audience. Entranced. Possessed.
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He
GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE
EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the
3.
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
Cutter gently places the canary into the ornate cage.
CUTTER (V.O.)
The second act is called the Turn...
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT
Angier, facing the audience, steps into the machine.
CUTTER (V.O.)
The magician takes the ordinary
something...
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Borden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS
TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITs LID PROPPED OPEN. Borden frowns.
CUTTER (V.O.)
...and makes it do something
extraordianry.
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
Cutter places a SILK SHAWL over the cage. Then SLAMS his
hands down on the shawl, which FLATTENS- The Little Girl
FLINCHES. Then STARES, FASCINATED.
CUTTER (V.O.)
Now you're looking for the secret.
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT
Bolts of electicity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball
of light which CRACKSCUTTER
(V.O.)
But you won't find it...
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The ROOM fills with light as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a
BODY DROPS INTO THE TANK.
CUTTER
Because of course, you're not really
looking...
The lid of the tank and trapdoor above SNAP SHUT, leaving
the tank, and Borden, in complete DARKNESS.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...you don't really want to know.
4.
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
Cutter WHIPS the shawl from the table. Cage and bird have
DISAPPEARED.
CUTTER (V.O.)
...you want to be fooled.
The Little Girl stares, EXPECTANT.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But you couldn't clap yet. Because
making something disappear isn't
enough... you have to bring it back.
INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The MACHINE sputters to a stop. Angier is GONE. The audience
sits, WAITING.
CUTTER (V.O.)
That's why every magic trick has a
third act. The hardest part..,
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
Cutter forms a fist. Drapes the shawl over it.
CUTTER (V.O.)
...the part we call...
Cutter WHIPS the shawl away to reveal- the CANARY. The
Little Girl CLAPS.
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- NIGHT
Borden LIGHTS another match. Stares in HORRORCUTTER
(V.O.)
...The Prestige.
Inside the tank, ANGIER IS DROWNING. His rolling EYES fixes
on BORDEN, he POUNDS desperately on the thick glass, SCREAMING
BUBBLES... The screen fades to BLACK.
PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
The Prestige...?
INT. COURTROOM -- DAY
The PROSECUTOR turns to face the witness in the box: Cutter.
PROSECUTOR
And did Robert Angier, the Great
Danton, your employer, get to that
final part of his trick that night?
5.
CUTTER
No, sir. Something went wrong.
PROSECUTOR
What went wrong?
CUTTER
I saw a someone head below the
stage... I followed... and I found
Borden-
Cutter points at the dock: Borden is there, CHAINED TO THE
FLOOR. FLANKED BY GUARDS. Cutter POINTS.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
-watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
PROSECUTOR
Would you describe your occupation
to the jury please, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER
I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions
and construct the apparatus necessary
for perfoming them.
PROSECUTOR
And for how long had you been
Mr.Angier's "ingeneur"?
CUTTER
Eight years. I was privvy to the
secrets of his entire act.
PROSECUTOR
So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled
tank beneath the stage part of
Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion
billed as "THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN"?
CUTTER
No, sir. The tank had been used for
the first trick, then taken offstage.
Borden must have put it under the
trap door after the interval.
Cutter looks across at Borden, who is absently tapping his
hand against the rail- it is MUTILATED, MISSING 2 1/2 FINGERS.
The DEFENDER STANDS.
DEFENDER
How large was this tank?
CUTTER
The sort of tank used for underwater
escapes- four or five hundred gallons.
6.
DEFENDER
How do you think Mr.Borden was able
to move the tank under the trap door
without anyone noticing?
CUTTER
Ask him- he's the magician.
Titters from the gallery. The Defenser turns to the JUDGE.
DEFENDER
(impatient)
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
CUTTER
(angry)
If I reveal my magician's secrets
here in open court, I'll be
unemployable and the secrets will be
worthless. The Real Transported Man
is the most sought-after illusion in
the business and I have te right to
sell it on.
The Judge considers this. He looks at Cutter. Sympathetic.
JUDGE
Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament
but we are talking about a capital
offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs
in the balance.
Cutter looks down. Quiet.
JUDGE (CONT'D)
If you were prepared to disclose the
details to me in private, I might be
able to judge their relevance to the
case.
(addresses lawyers)
Might this be an acceptable
compromisse?
Amid murmurs of assent, the Judge ADJOURNS the proceedings.
As the Guards begin the complex ritual of unlocking Borden's
chainsa from the floor, Borden's looks across the courtroom:
The LITTLE GIRL from the opening stands in the gallery,
looking back at him. Borden gives her a little WAVE. She
waves back, then is GUIDED OUT by a man wearing GLOVES and
BOWLER HAT- this is FALLON. He nods at Borden.
7.
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN
of the guard walks out to greet him.
CAPTAIN
I'm going to have to ask you to turn
out your pockets.
Owens raises his eyebrows.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw
his show in Manchester last year
where he vanished into thin airhe's
convinced he'll try an escape.
Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet.
They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms
over them.
A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed
absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES
begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up
to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
I told him the only way Borden's
going to disappear is if I leave him
out with the others immates.
At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a
thick eye hook set into the ground.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
(to warders)
Check the locks. Twice.
They check the locks. Then retreat to allow privacy. The
Captain marches away. Borden looks at Owens. Bored.
OWENS
My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
Borden says nothing.
OWENS (CONT'D)
I represent Lord Caldlow, and
accomplished amateur magician and
historian of magic-
BORDEN
How much?
OWENS
Lord Caldlow is interested in8.
BORDEN
(cold)
How much for my tricks?
OWENS
Five thousand pounds.
BORDEN
Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the
money's for him.
OWENS
I did. He offered to sell all of
your tricks... except the most
valuable one - The Transported Man.
BORDEN
I'd never forgive myself for selling
my greatest trick.
Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
OWENS
Even for your daughter?
Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive.
OWENS (CONT'D)
If the newspapers are right, and
you're for the drop, your daughter's
going to need looking after
BORDEN
Fallon can take care of-
OWENS
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
even more obscure than your own?
The court have already motioned to
have the girl removed from his "care".
No, the girl is to be an orphan.
I've been to the work house...
Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs.
OWENS (CONT'D)
It's better than this.
Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden.
OWENS (CONT'D)
I'm offering you a way to warp up
your affairs with dignity, and I'm
offering your daughter a future. As
Lord Caldlow's ward she will want
for nothing. Ever.
(hands him a card)
Think it over.
9.
Borden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX.
OWENS (CONT'D)
Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this-
(produces a leather
bound JOURNAL)
As a show of good faith. He thought
it might be of interest.
A SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal, flicks through it.
OWENS (CONT'D)
Robert Angier's diary... It includes
the time he spent in Colorado learning
your trick...
Sullen hands the journal to Borden. Borden takes it.
BORDEN
Angier never learned my trick.
OWENS
Really? When he returned from
Colorado he mounted a version of the
Transported Man that the papers said
was better, even...
(with relish)
Than your original.
BORDEN
(acid)
If you want Angier's secret you can
dig him up and ask him for yourself.
Borden TURNS, dragging the Warders with him.
OWENS
I want your secret, Mr.Borden...
(louder)
Consider your daughter!
INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
Borden, on the bed, opens Angier's JOURNAL. Starts to read...
ANGIER (V.O.)
A cypher. An enigma...
CUT TO:
LETTERS ON A PAGE. IN MEANINGLESS COMBINATIONS. GIBBERISH.
INT. TRAIN, MOUNTAINS -- DUSK
Aniger, with a SIGH, closes a CARDBOARD-COVERED NOTEBOOK.
OPENS his LEATHER-BOUND JOURNAL. Starts to write.
10.
ANGIER (V.O.)
...Borden's cypher is simpleunraveled
by a single word. Now it
takes only patience. And a passion
to know his mind.
Angier lloks up at his own reflection in the train window.
EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DUSK
No platform, no office, no sign. Just an electric streetlight
which, as Angier watches, FLICKERS ON. Angier, leaning
heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at
it as he's never seen one before.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado
Springs.
Angier looks back and smiles. A driver is looking down
expectantly from atop a STAGECOACH. Angier hands his cane
up to the driver nd , with some difficulty, hitches his way
up to the roof of the rig. As he does, the town of Colorado
Springs rises into view, a few hundred yards down the road,
lit brightly with ELECTRIC STREETLIGHTS.
ANGIER
(disbelief)
The whole town has electricity?
The driver nods and WHIPS the horses into action.
EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- EVENING
The Stagecoach flies along, inches from a precipitious drop.
It rounds a corner and pulls to a halt in front of the CLIFF
HOUSE INN, equal parts log cabin and crystal palace.
INT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS
The lobby is cavernous and immaculate. The entire STAFF of
the hotel - BELLBOYS, MAIDS, COOKS, and GARDENERS - are lined
up along the sides like a regiment of soldiers.
Angier reaches the reception desk and the smiling MANAGER.
ANGIER
Quit a reception.
MANAGER
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr.Angier.
(opens guest book)
Your telegram didn't indicate how
long you would be staying with us.
11.
ANGIER
As long as it takes.
(signs book)
I'll need a coach tomorrow to take
me up the mountain.
MANAGER
The peak is closed, sit. For
scientific experimentation.
ANGIER
(smiles)
That's why I'm here.
EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
A stagecoach rumbles along a dirt track, The driver pulls
on his reigns and the coach pulls to a stop.
DRIVER
You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid,
sir.
Angier nods. Lowers himself down to the roadway.
EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
Angier comes through the trees to find a wire fence with a
sign: EXTREME DANGER- NO TRESPASSING
Beyond the fence is a COMPOUND of three BARNS. Rising from
the center barn is a 200ft steel TOWER capped with a GIANT
STEEL BALL. GIANT ARCING BOLTS of electricity run down the
tower from the ball. The windows of the building RADIATH
with BLUE EXPLOSIONS.
Angier stops forwards, entranced, and threads his fingers
through the fence.
He is sent FLYING backwards -- the fence has been electrified.
The tower is SHUT OFF- a door opens and a stout little MAN,
shotgun under one arm, MARCHES up to the fence. He uses a
RUBBER PAD to pry open the fence and stands over Angier, who
is CURLED on the ground, GROWNLING in pain, trying to stand.
SHOTGUN
I'm amazed at how many of you
newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
Shotgun picks up Angier's cane and hands it to him.
ANGIER
Not the welcome I was expecting.
Shotgun RECOGNIZES Angier, AMAZED.
12.
SHOTGUN
I know you. You're that magician-the
Great Danton.
(helps Angier up)
I'm Alley. I saw your show. IN
London. Seven times- you guessed
every object the audience had in
their pockets.
Angier leans on his cane and gently brushes off the dirt.
ALLEY
I'm sorry about the fence. People
keep interfering with our work.
ANGIER
I've come to see Tesla.
ALLEY
Why?
ANGIER
He built a machine for a- for a
colleague of mine. A long time ago.
Can you get me a meeting with him?
(off his look)
I've come a very long way.
ALLEY
Impossible, I'm afraid.
ANGIER
I've brought a lot of money.
Beat.
ALLEY
I'm sorry, Mr.Angier. I simply can't
help you.
Alley pulls the fence closed.
ANGIER
I'll be staying at the hotel.
Indefinitely.
Alley watches Angier walk away. He pulls something from his
pocket.
ALLEY
What am I holding?
Angier doesn't look back.
ANGIER
Your watch.
Alley GRINS, opening his hand. He is holding a gold watch.
13.
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY
Angier sits, the cardboard-bound notebook on the table in
front of him. He makes a notations in his own journal as he
deciphers Borden's words.
ANGIER (V.O.)
April 3rd, 1893... a few days after
he first met me...
Angier runs his finger along the first line, translating...
BORDEN (V.O.)
We were too young men at the start
of a great career...
INT. THEATRE -- NIGHT
Borden sits in the audience. Younger- both hands intact.
BORDEN (V.O.)
Two young man devoted to an
illusion...
Two rows in front sits Angier. Similarly youthful.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Two young men who never intended to
hurt anyone.
Onstage is a TANK. Standing beside the tank is a beautiful
young magician's assistant. JULIA.
The magician, MILTOn, adress the audience.
MILTON
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman...
Milton GESTURES to Julia- the MEN in the crowd go wild- hands
in the air, catcalls. Smiling radiantly, Julia selects two
young men, who SCRAMBLE up to the stage- ANGIER and BORDEN:
younger, full of energy- Angier has no limp.
They spring onto stage, beside Julia and take the ROPE she
offers them. Milton GRABS a HOOK that descends from the
flies on a chain.
Cutter is watching fron the wings.
MILTON (CONT'D)
Are either of you two gentlemen
gailors?
Both shakes their hands as they start to bind Julia with the
ropes, Borden wrapping the rope around her wrists, Angier
the one around her ankles.
14.
MILTON (CONT'D)
Well, I'm sure you can both tie a
strong knot...
As Borden finishes his knot tests it, it SLIPS APART.
Borden frowns, hastly RETYING it, covering.
Cutter NOTICES.
Borden finishes, glancing at julia who gives a small sign of
assent with her eyes. As Angier finishes tying her ankles
he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle. She frowns at him and
raises her arms. Milton hooks the rope onto the chain.
Milton gesticulates in the wings, Cutter signals to a
stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air.
Milton wheels the tank under Julia's bare feet. Cutter feels
for the handle of an AXE placed by his feet and pulls out a
STOPWATCH.
JULIA looks down at Angier. They smile at each other. Julia
DROPS into the tank with a massive splash- Milton SLAMS the
lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank...
Cutter checks his stopwatch, grips the handle of the axe...
A grand GESTURE from Milton- the curtain around the tank
DROPS- Julia is GONE. Milton raises the curtain again, then
with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the
tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling.
The audience erupts in APPLAUSE. Angier smiles produly.
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
Angier, Borden and Julia sit around the cluttered room.
Borden is in the middle of a passionate rant-
BORDEN
Milton's squadering their goodwill
or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
ANGIER
(amused)
Old favourites, please.
BORDEN
What about something fresh? He won't
even try a bullet catch-
CUTTER (O.S.)
Bullet catch is suicide.
They turn. Cutter stands in the doorway, counting out money.
15.
CUTTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
All it takes is a smart-arse volunteer
dropping a button down the barrel...
BORDEN
(indicates himself
and Angier)
Use plants-
ANGIER
He can't use plants for every trick.
JULIA
There'd be no seats left for the
punters.
BORDEN
Fine- no bullet catch. But a real
magician tries to invent something
new, something other magicians scratch
their heads over-
CUTTER
They sells it to them for a small
fortune.
Cutter hands Angier some money.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
I suposse you have such a trick,
Mr.Borden?
ANGIER
Actually, I do.
CUTTER
Care to sell it?
BORDEN
No one else could do my trick.
ANGIER
I could.
BORDEN
You don't even know what it is.
ANGIER
Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
Cutter looks at Borden, thoughtful.
CUTTER
I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier.
But if Borden here really has invented
his masterpiece it might well be
something only he can do.
16.
ANGIER
Why?
CUTTER
It might be something only he is
prepared to do.
(gestures to the props)
my illusions employer, Mr.Milton,
is a skilled showman. But Borden's
right- he won't get his hands dirty.
You want to see what it takes to
make real magic- go to the Tenley.
There's a Chinaman there who's got
what it takes.
ANGIER
Chung Ling Soo.
BORDEN
Tickets are pricey.
CUTTER
I know a lad on the door. You two
watch his show- whoever tells me how
he does his goldfish bowl trick gets
the prize.
ANGIER
Which is?
Cutter gives a sly smile.
CUTTER
Ten minutes onstage in front of my
old friend, Mr.Ackerman.
Angier and Borden prick up at the name.
JULIA
Who's Ackerman?
BORDEN
The most powerful theatrical agent
in London.
Cutter holds out money to Borden, who reaches for it- Cutter
grabs his wrist. Serious.
CUTTER
I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
JULIA
I think I had my wrist turned17.
CUTTER
(ignoring Julia)
Some nights you just can't get it,
can you? If that knot slips when
Julia's on the hoist she'll break a
leg.
BORDEN
(defensive)
It's the wrong knot. A Langford
double would hold tighter.
CUTTER
The Langford double's not a wet knot
it's too dangerous. The ropes could
swell and she'd never slip it-
JULIA
I can slip a Lanford underwater.
BORDEN
We've been practiced it-
ANGIER
(cutting in)
He said no.
Julia glances at Angier.
CUTTER
(to Borden)
No more mistakes.
Borden stares at Cutter. Leaves. Angier watches him go.
ANGIER
Where's he from?
CUTTER
Where are you from?
Angier nods. Fair enough.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
He shuffles props for Virgil at the
Hall.
ANGIER
He works for another magician? Aren't
you worried he'll steal your tricks?
CUTTER
(shakes head)
He doesn't deal in methods.
ANGIER
How do you know?
18.
CUTTER
(sly smile)
Because I hired him to try and find
out Virgil's orange trick.
ANGIER
I don't know if I trust him.
CUTTER
He's a natural magician. Of course
you can't trust him.
JULIA
I think he's alright.
Angier turns to Julia. Smiles.
ANGIER
You think everyone's alright.
JULIA
Even you.
Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises.
CUTTER
And Mr.Angier...?
(Angier looks up)
Learn your aight lines- if I can see
you sneaking a peck on your wife's
ankle from the wings, the blokes on
each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.
INT. THEATRE, CONVENT GARDEN -- EVENING
Borden watches from the wings. Onstage, a magician, Virgil,
locks a CANARY into a cage then covers the cage with a SHAWL.
Borden notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in the front row with
a little BOY who is watching Virgil's act, spellbound.
Virgil SLAMS the SHAWL down onto the table, as if nothing
were beneath it, then WHIPS it away- BIRD and CAGE are gone.
The little BOY begins to WAIL and CRY.
Borden watches as the young woman tries to make him stop.
Virgil takes the flower from his lapel, covers it with the
shawl, and SNAPS it away- the flower has become the CANARY.
The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little
boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY. Virgil takes bows and
walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage.
As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols
the bird in front of the boy.
BORDEN
Look- he's all right. He's fine.
19.
BOY
(sniffs)
But where's his brother?
Borden is at a loss. He turns to the young woman.
BORDEN
Sharp lad, your son.
YOUNG WOMAN
(laughs)
My brother.
Borden smiles back.
INT. WORKSHOP -- LATER
Borden gently strokes the bird's feathered head.
BORDEN
You're the lucky one tonight.
Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one
with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage
and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the
TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE.
Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart.
A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below.
Borden SLAPS the cage.
And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out
and SPLASHES into the bucket.
EXT. STAGE DOOR -- EVENING
Borden exits. The young woman, SARAH, is there with her
brother.
BORDEN
(to the brother)
Are you watching closely?
Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin.
The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Look closer.
BOY
It's got two heads.
Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave.
BORDEN
Never. Show. Anyone.
20.
The Boy looks at him, a little afraid.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
They'll beg you and flatter you for
the secret- but as soon as you give
it up you'll be nothing to them.
Understand? Nothing. The secret
impresses no one- the trick you use
it for is everything.
Borden looks into the boy's staring eyes. Then SMILES and
pets him on the head. he stands. Sarah smiles at him.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Where do you two live?
SARAH
He lives with Mum.
BORDEN
And you?
INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING
Sarah lingers at the top of the stairs to her flat. Borden
tries to KISS her, but she pushes him back. He tests the
LOCK of the open door.
BORDEN
Enough to keep me out?
SARAH
I think so. Wil I see you again?
Borden SHRUGS and turns to go back down the stairs. Sarah
looks after him, about to change her min. Hesitates.
INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- CONTINUOUS
She closes the door and LOCKS it, smiling. After a moment
she pads through living/kitchen area, draws back the curtain
to her bedroom and SHRIEKS:
Borden is there, smiling. Sarah moves towards him, giggling.
INT. TENLEY THEATRE -- NIGHT
Onstage, CHUNG LING SOO, 60's, wearing a long silk robe,
HOBBLES painfully to the center of the stage. Clearly
CRIPPLED. In the audience, Borden and Angier watch intently.
Soo lays a silk SHAWL and a BARE TABLE. He WHIPS it up,
revealing a BOUQUET OF ROSES. So repeats the trick again
and again, producing a different object each time.
Finally, with a drum roll, Soo whips the shawl aside to reveal
a MASSIVE GOLDFISH BOWL, complete with GOLDFISH.
21.
To THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, Soo bows and HOBBLES off the stage.
Angier, clapping, shakes his head, utterly baffled. He turns
to Borden. Who has a small, knowing, smile.
EXT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
Borden and Angier watch Soo being helped down from his
carriege by HANDLERS who treat him with great gentleness.
ANGIER
You're wrong. It can't be.
BORDEN
It is. He carries the bowl between
his knees for the entire performance.
ANGIER
but look at the man!
BORDEN
(points)
This is the trick. This is why no
one detectes his method.
Soo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Total devotion to his art...
(looks at Angier)
Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only
way to escape this.
Borden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them.
INT. BEDSIT -- NIGHT
Julia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like
a robe, HOBBLING. He pulls up the sheeyt- between his knees
is a goldfish bowl.
ANGIER
I can barely lift this thing and
it's not even filled with water. Or
fish. He must be strong as an ox.
JULIA
(incredulous)
He's been preteding to be an cripple
for years?
ANGIER
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.
Angier puts the bowl down with a flourish. Climbs into bed.
22.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Borden saw it at once. I couldn't
fathom it- living your whole life
pretending to be someone else.
JULIA
You're pretending to be someone else.
ANGIER
I don't think changing your name
compares.
JULIA
Not just your name- who you are,
where you're from...
ANGIER
I promised my family I wouldn't
embarrass them with my theatrical
endeavors.
Angier cuddles up to Julia.
JULIA
I came up with a name for you...
"The Great Danton"
(Angier frowns)
You don't like it? It's
sophisticated.
ANGIER
It's French.
INT. BEDSIT -- DAY
Sarah unlocks the door, but has to PUSH against MAGICAL PROPS
stacked against it- the bedsit is FILLED with DEVICES.
SARAH
Alfred?!
Sarah surveys the confusion- spots Borden across the flat
deep in conversation with another man. Borden spots her-
BORDEN
We have our routine for Ackerman!
The other man turns- it is Fallon.
SARAH
(cold)
We haven't had the pleasure.
Fallon nods. Borden comes over, holding a DUELING PISTOL.
BORDEN
Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur23.
SARAH
Where did yo get all of-
BORDEN
Begged, borrowed and don't ask.
Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
SARAH
I need talk to you.
Fallon slips past Sarah with a nod to Borden. Exits. Sarah
looks at Borden. TENSE.
SARAH (CONT'D)
We can't afford to pay him-
BORDEN
We'll start making money once we
have our audience-
SARAH
And until then? What I earn is barely
enough for us.
BORDEN
(shrugs)
I'll give him half of my food.
Sarah looks meaningfully at Borden.
SARAH
You're already going to be sharing
it with someone else.
Borden looks at her, confused. Then realizes.
BORDEN
You're...?
SARAH
Having a baby.
Borden freezes. Then SMILES, taking her in his arms. She
FLINCHES against the gun he is holding.
SARAH (CONT'D)
What's this?
BORDEN
The trick to wake up Ackerman at the
end of my audition.
SARAH
Your great trick? The "masterpiece
that will make our fortunes"?
24.
BORDEN
No. The world isn't ready for that
one, yet.
Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun.
Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...
BORDEN (CONT'D)
This is merely a run-of-the-mill
daring and spectacular bullet catch-
Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...
SARAH
I'm not letting you get shot.
Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD
and hands the pistol to Sarah.
BORDEN
It's perfectly safe. Shoot me.
Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at
Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him.
BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to "catch" the bullet. The
mirror is intact.
Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in
his hand.
SARAH
Show me.
(Borden shakes head)
Then you're not doing it. I can't
raise a child on my own, Alfred.
Borden looks at her. Takes the bullet from her and places
it on the bureau.
BORDEN
The bullet goes in the gun. Then
comes the ramrod.
He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which
disappears.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
And voils-
He points the ramrod at Sarah- she pulls the bullet out of
the HOLLOW TIP.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
The buller's not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.
Sarah looks at ramrod with disdain.
25.
SARAH
Once you know it's so obvious.
Borden BRISTLES slightly. Takes the bullet back.
BORDEN
Yes, well, people still get killed
perfoming it.
SARAH
How?
BORDEN
Sme smart-arse drops something down
the barrel.
SARAH
Such as?
BORDEN
A penny, or a button. Or, of course,
a bullet.
(off worried look)
But don't fret-
Borden embraces her, putting his hand on her belly.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
I'm not letting anything happen- I
love you too much.
Sarah grabs his face, looking at his eyes, smiling.
SARAH
Say it again.
BORDEN
I love you.
SARAH
(matter-of-fact)
Nope. Not today.
BORDEN
What?
SARAH
(smiles)
Some days, it's not true. Todayt
you don't mean it. Maybe today you're
more in love with magic than me.
(off look)
It's alright. I like being able to
tell the difference- it makes the
days it is true mean something.
Borden shakes his head, grinning.
26.
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT
Angier closes Borden's notebook. He looks across at a
photograph of julia on the table. Reaches for his own diary.
ANGIER (V.O.)
Borden writes as if no one but he
understood the true nature of magic...
INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
Borden sits on his cot reading Angier's journal.
ANGIER (V.O.)
...but what does he know of selfsacrifice
more than the rest of us?
Borden looks up from Angier's journal.
BORDEN
Bloody fool.
Borden TOSSES the book across the cell.
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM, WARHOUSE -- DAY
A POLICEMAN opens the door for the Judge and Cutter.
POLICEMAN
(pointing)
It's all laid out down the end, you
honour.
The Judge NODS. The Policeman exits, LOCKING them inside.
The Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical
apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE. Cutter looks up at it
with AWE, touching the side where it says "COLORADO SPRINGS".
JUDGE
What's in there?
Cutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within.
CUTTER
Angier's machine.
JUDGE
You built this, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER
(shakes head)
Oh no. This wasn't built by a
magician... it was built by a wizard.
(off look)
A man who can actually do the things
a magician pretends to...
27.
Cutter closes the crats. The JUDGE turns to other props.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
your honour, what will happen to
these things when the trial is over?
The Judge is staring at a large glass tank.
JUDGE
They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo.
An avid collector, apparently very
interested in the case.
CUTTER
Don't let him take this.
The Judge looks over. Cutter is touching the crate.
JUDGE
Why ever not?
CUTTER
It's dangerous.
JUDGE
I'm sure beneath its bells and
whistles it's get some simple and
disappointing trick.
CUTTER
The most disappointing of all- it
has no trick. It's real.
The Judge looks at Cutter. Smiles indulgently. Turns.
JUDGE
This is the tank Angier drowned in?
Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank.
Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is
a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid-
CUTTER
This lets the performer's hands reach
the trick padlock...
-a small section POPS open.
JUDGE
A standard magical apparatus for
escapes?
CUTTER
With one important difference...
Cutter grabs the PADLOCK. Rattles it.
28.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
This isn't a trick lock... it's been
switched out for a real one.
The Judge stares at the tank, appaled.
JUDGE
What a way to kill someone. Why in
God's name go to such lengths?
CUTTER
These are magicians, you honour.
Showmen. Men who live by dressing
up plain and sometimes brutal truths
to amaze. To shock.
JUDGE
Even without and audience?
Cutter stares at the tank-
INSERT CUT: ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES.
CUTTER
There was and audience.
(looks at Judge)
See, the water tank had a particular
signinficance for the two men...
INT. THEATRE -- EVENING
Onstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER.
CUTTER (V.O.)
A particular awful significance...
Julia stands next to the tank. Milton adresses the audience.
MILTON
Which of you brave souls is willing
bind this lovely young woman?
Milton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild. Julia makes
a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are
made up to look different from the last performance. As
they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter
in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE.
As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just
under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin.
Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a
particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at
him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot.
Cutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle.
29.
Borden tests the rope- it is tight. Julia gives him the
sign with her eyes- he steps back. Angier rises to his feet,
grinning at Julia. As she raises her arms to the hook, she
can't quite hide her smile back at him.
Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air.
Cutter slips his STOPWATCH out of his pocket as Milton moes
the tank under Julia's bare feet.
Angier looks up at Julia. Proud. She stares out over the
audience, preparing herself. Looks down at Angier, smiling...
Julia PLUNGES into the tank- Milton SLAMS the lid shut- Cutter
checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle...
Milton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it,
working his "magic". Angier shifts a little. Time passing...
Milton looks at Cutter- TOO MUCH TIME...
Cutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank- Milton RIPS
the curtain down- Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING...
Angier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe
into the glass- which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and againthe
web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her
eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until-
CRASH- the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage- Cutter and
Angier GRASP at Julia- FULL her onto the stage- Cutter ELBOWS
Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest- Borden
wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards.
Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken.
Angier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring
eyes. He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and
forehead. Borden looks on, shen.
BORDEN (V.O.)
How often I've fought with my self
over that night .. one half of me
swearing bling that i tied a simple
slip knot... the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double. I
suppose I'll never know for sure-
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY
Angier looks up from Borden's journal, despairing.
ANGIER
How can be not know?!
Angier FLINGS Borden's journal across the room.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He must know what he did. He must.
30.
INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY
Borden smiles as he reads Angier's dairy.
BORDEN
"How can be not know?!"
(starts lauhing)
Because, Angier, life is complicated,
people are complicated, knots are
complicated-
PRISONER (O.S.)
Shit it, Professor, or I'll shut it
for you.
Borden quiets. Looking at the journal.
BORDEN (V.O.)
How could I not know? How can you
read my story and not understand?
INT. COURTROOM -- DAY
Cutter sits in the CROWDED GALLERY. Borden, in the dock,
SCANS the crowd. Finally SPOTS Fallon pushing to the fronthe
is alone. Borden stares at him. Fallon shakes his dead.
Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters.
The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig.
JUDGE
Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.
You will, in one month's time, be
hanged by the neck until dead. May
the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Borden barely reacts.
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
Borden stands at the fence with Fallon
BORDEN
They took her away?
(Fallon nods)
To the workhouse?
Another slow nod. Borden closes his eyes with despair. Then
opens them and hands Fallon OWENS' CARD.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Tell him I've reconsidered.
(off look)
It's for the best.
31.
INT. DINING ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN, COLORADO SPRING -- DUSK
Angier stares down at the NOTEBOOK, making notes on a napkin.
Through large windows a THUNDERSTORM batters Pike's Peak.
Angier is the only guest in the hotel's massive dining room.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mind if I join you?
Angier looks around. Alley is standing by the table.
ALLEY
Tesla sends me down here during the
storms. Perfect excuse to come shere
a drink with the Great Danton.
Alley sits, gesturing to a waiter.
ALLEY (CONT'D)
Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr.
Angier? It matches the scenery
nicely.
(to waiter)
Two of 'em.
(to Angier)
Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New
York, though.
ANGIER
Why are you here?
ALLEY
The lightning lives here. And noit
much else- our work is secret.
Alley glances down at the notebook and Agier's scribbles.
ALLEY (CONT'D)
A cypher?
Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook.
ANGIER
My profession also deals in secrets.
Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
It's a rotating transposition that
shifts every day of the dairy. Simple
but time-consuming to translate once
you have the five-letter keyword.
ALLEY
Which is?
Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook.
32.
ANGIER
We magicians have a circle of trust.
ALLEY
You have a circle of trust with
someone whose dairy you stole?
ANGIER
Maybe I bought it.
ALLEY
Magicians sell their secrets?
ANGIER
It's how we pay for our retirements
and how greats tricks outlive us.
Alley considers this. Taps the cover of the notebook.
ALLEY
You're hoping to find a great secretin
there?
ANGIER
I've already found it. That's why
I'm here.
Angier reaches in his pocket and removes his own, leatherbound
journal. He tears a PAGE from it and hands it to Alley.
Who unfolds it ans stares at it.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Tesla built one for another magician.
ALLEY
Why would you want the same thing?
ANGIER
Call it a professional rivalry.
ALLEY
Tesla has built unusual machines for
unusual people, but he would never
talk about it.
ANGIER
I understand discretion. I just
want the machine.
Alley looks at Angier. Thinking.
ALLEY
Finish your drink. You'll have a
special appreciation for our work.
ANGIER
I thought it was a secret.
33.
ALLEY
(smiles)
You're a magician. Who's going to
believe you?
EXT. FIELDS, COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT
The storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground
as he follows Alley through the moonlit field.
There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if
planted all around them. They stop in the middle of the
field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town.
ALLEY
We do our tests when the townspeople
are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to
scare anyone.
Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight.
ALLEY (CONT'D)
Not long now.
As they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR.
ALLEY (CONT'D)
Our equipment requires a great deal
of current. Tesla eletrified the
whole town in exchange for using the
generators when we need to.
The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT. Angier
laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large
LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks
up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it
extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the
size, it's a normal lightbulb.
ANGIER
Where are the wires?
ALLEY
Exactly.
Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random
spot in the wet soil. The lightbulb FLICKERS on again.
ANGIER
Where's the generator?
ALLEY
You saw it last week.
ANGIER
But that must be ten miles from here.
34.
ALLEY
Fifteen. And I have to ride all of
them before I get to bed.
(turns to leave)
I'll send word for you in a few days,
Mr.Angier.
Angier bends to pick up his lightbulb. As he does, the light
FADES in all of them, and the lights in town come back on.
Angier is alone.
INT. BATHROOM, LONDON -- DAY
Angier has his head SUBMERGED in a sink full of water. He
BURSTS FREE, GASPING- COLLA`PSES to the floor, SOBBING.
INT. BATHROOM -- LATER
Angier lays out MAKE-UP SUPPLIES. He takes out a BULLE.
Places it on the sink next to a FALSE MOUNSTAGE.
EXT. PRINCE'S ARMS BAR AND THEATRE
Rough. Unwelcoming. Crowded. A small "stage" at one end:
Borden works his way through the Chinese rings. The crowd
is JEERING.
VOICE
Get out your gun, Professor!
Someone BURLS a bottle at the stage- it narrowly misses.
Borden GLARES out into the audience. Pulls out his GUN.
BORDEN
A volunteer.
The crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS. Fallon scans
the crowd, passing over too-eager and too-drunk before
settling on a MOUNSTACHED MAN and bringing him up onstage.
Borden LOADS the pistol, hands it to Moustache and steps
backwards, pulling his coat apart, CHALLENGING.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Are you man enought, sir?
MOUSTACHE
(quiet)
Yes.
Something in Moustache's tone makes Borden looks closelybehind
the moustache... Angier. QUIVERING WITH TENSION.
35.
Borden looks at the trembling gun. Then at Angier. Spreads
his hands, inviting.
BORDEN
(smiles)
I think not.
Angier purses his lips, straining to pull the trigger.
INSERT CUT: JULIA'S FACE, SCREAMING BUBBLES...
Angier's eyes are almost closed as he SQUEEZES the TRIGGERFallon
HITS Angier JUMPS to Borden's side, GRABBING his
BLEEDING HAND. The DROWS is SCREAMING, PUSHING for the door,
os STRAINING for a closer look at Borden.
Aniger, SHOCKED, melts into the crowd.
INT. PUB -- DAY
Angier sits at the bar. Staring. He raises his pint glass.
Downs it, then STOPS, looking at the bottom- there is a
PLAYING CARD. He loos around. Cutter is sitting at a table
with two fresh pints in front of him. Angier heads over.
ANGIER
Never thought I'd find an answer at
the bottom of a pint glass.
CUTTER
Hasn't stopped you looking.
(Angier sits)
I heard about a booking. Nice little
theatre. Good up-and-coming magician.
ANGIER
Who?
CUTTER
You.
ANGIER
You got me a booking? Why?
Cutter looks down into his beer.
CUTTER
Because I want to keep working...
(looks up at Angier)
And who's going to hire the ingeneur
who killed Julia McCullough in front
of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
Angier looks back at Cutter.
36.
ANGIER
Someone who know that it wasn't your
fault. Someone who knows Alfred
Borden and his repertoire of exotic
knots.
CUTTER
Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing
a bullet catch South of the river.
Angier looks down at the liquid in his glass.
ANGIER
To die like that. Locked in water...
lungs screaming...
(shakes head)
What did she go through, Cutter?
Cutter watches Angier's distress.
CUTTER
I knew an old sailor. Told me about
a time he got pulled over the side
tangled in the sheets... they dragged
him out, but it was five minutes
before he coughed...
Angier stares at Cutter. Hanging.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
He said it was like... going home.
Angier considers this. Collects himself.
ANGIER
Which knot did Borden tie that night?
CUTTER
He wouldn't say.
ANGIER
Wouldn't say?!
CUTTER
It was as if... as if he didn't know.
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier and Cutter isspect a large empty room.
CUTTER
We'll have to whitewash the windows
to cofound the more curious members
of your audience...
(looks around)
But this should do.
37.
ANGIER
We should see about an assistant.
CUTTER
I've made arrangements. Have you
settled on a name?
ANGIER
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.
CUTTER
Hmm. Bit old-fashioned?
Angier smiles gently at Cutter.
ANGIER
No. It's sophisticated.
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier is sitting at a worktable, pensive. He is moving one
hand across the other, making a ROSE appear and disappear.
The windows have been WHITEWASHED and the room has filled
with an array of magical apparati: cabinets, costumes, props.
On the other side of the room Cutter watches as OLIVIA
WENSCOMBE, 20s, equal parts grace and mischief, squeezes
herself into a tall cabinet, looking past Cutter to Angier.
OLIVIA
What's so hard about this?
Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in
the floor, revealing a tiny chamber.
CUTTER
In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point
meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit.
Olivia shrugs and hands Cutter her hat, then her thick skirts,
and folds herself into the bottom of the box.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
Breathe as little as possible.
Cutter closes the lid over her and walks over to Angier.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
Not much experience , but she knows
the basics. She knows how to present
herself and a pretty assistant's the
most effective from of misdirection.
Angier nods. There is a small SNEEZE from inside the cabinet.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
(smiles)
I suppose I should let her out.
38.
INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- DAY
Sarah is frantcally REDRESSIN Borden's injured hand. BLOOD
has SEEPED trough the bandages.
SARAH
I don't understand, Alfred. How can
it be bleeding again?
She examines the wounds: 2 1/2 FINGERS ARE MISSING. The
injuries are black, but wet and fresh.
SARAH (CONT'D)
What have you been doing to it? It
looks as had as the day it happened.
We need to get the doctot back-
BORDEN
(snaps)
We can' afford the doctor back!
A BABY STARTS CRYING in the bedroom. Sarah glares at Borden.
SARAH
You've woken her.
BORDEN
I'm sorry. I just need this to heal
so I can het back to work.
Sarah looks at Borden. Reluctantly.
SARAH
Alfred, you have to face things.
What tricks could you peform with
this kind of injury?
BORDEN
Some of the card pulls, prop tricks...
(leans forward, excited)
And the trick I've been telling you
about. The trick they'll remember
me for.
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier and Cutter at the workbench, examine a BIRD CAGE.
Cutter is wearing a strange LEATHER HARNESS over his shirt
it has LARGE SPRINGS and small PULLEYS on the back.
ANGIER
The bird cage can't be our climaxeverybody
knows it.
CUTTER
Not like this, they don't.
39.
ANGIER
And I don't want to kill doves.
CUTTER
(snaps)
Then stay off the stage.
(glares at Angier)
You're a magician, not a wizard- you
have to get your hands dirty to
achieve the impossible.
ANGIER
You sound like him.
CUTTER
(holds up cage)
Put your hands on the sides...
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY
A heavy, disinterested man slouches in the third row of the
empty theatre with a newspaper- MERRIT, the stage manager.
Onstage, Angier energetically YANKS coloured handkerchiefs
from a hat and TOSSING them into the air. Olivia, in the
glamorous, revealing costume of Magician's Assistant, darts
back and forth PLUCKING the handkerchiefs from the air.
Angier finishes with a flourish. Merrit shrugs. Angier
places an ORNATE CAGE onto the table.
ANGIER
I need a volunteer.
Merrit rolls his eyes. Climbs to his feet. Angier produces
a DOVE. Places it in the cage.
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Now Angier is wearing the harness. He places a dove in the
cage and picks it up.
Close on: HOOKS concealed on Angier's palm slip into CATCHES
on the bars of the cage.
CUTTER
Hang on, hang on...
Cutter reaches in and slips a NOOSE around the bird's ankle...
CUTTER (CONT'D)
There we go. Now you tell the
volunteer to put his hands here...
Cutter pleases his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the cage...
40.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT
Merrit places his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the bird
cage. Angier's hands are on the sides. Olivia reaches around
Merrit to place her hands on the remaining two sides. Merrit
looks up at Angier over his glasses.
MERRIT
You'd beat not be intending to hut
this animal, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER
Of course not.
Angier raises and lowers their hands in a rythm...
ANGIER (CONT'D)
And one, two... THREE!
The bird cage, and the dove, VANISH.
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier and Cutter have their hands on the bird cage.
ANGIER
...THREE!
The bird cage BREAKS APART, WHIPPING UP ANGIER'S FOREARMS.
WHERE SLEEVES WOULD BE, YANKED BY THE HARNESS. Angier smiles.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
CUTTER
And the best part...
Cutter reaches to Angier's armpit... pulls up the DOVE,
HANGING BY ITS ANKLE, ALIVE.
ANGIER
Thought you said I had to get my
hands dirty.
CUTTER
Someday, perhaps you will. I needed
to know that you can.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY
Merrit nods, impressed, stepping backwards. Angier REACHES
into Merrit's pocket. Removes a dove.
MERRIT
Very nice. Very nice indeed.
Olivia packs up the props. Cutter approaches from the wings.
41.
ANGIER
(smiling)
I haven't had a chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theatre yet,
Mr.Merrit.
MERRIT
A lot more beautiful when it's full,
Mr.Angier.
ANGIER
Don't worry.
MERRIT
You all say that. Why sould I worry?
If your tricks don't get 'em in,
someone else's will. Maybe someone
willing to do a bullet catch or a
water scape.
CUTTER
cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People
hoping for an accident- and quite
likely to see one, too. What would
that do for your business?
MERRIT
(shrugs)
You've got a week.
EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
A line a PATRONS runs from the box office to the street.
The marquee above the theatre reads: "THE GREAT DANTON PERFOMS
FEATS OF MISTERY AND IMAGINATION"
INT. THEATRE -- EVENING
Angier is perfoming to a good crowd. He steps forward.
ANGIER
You sir, in the hat. Could you show
us your handkerchief?
A MAN in the audience STANDS and pulls a HANDKERCHIEF from
his pocket. He stares at it, CONFUSED. The audience LAUGHS.
MAN
This isn't mine.
ANGIER
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return
it to the other man. He has yours.
Another man stands and pulls out a handkerchief. APPLAUSE.
Angier dows and walks quickly off the stage, past the squad
of DANCING GIRLS who run on to entertain in the break.
42.
INT. BACKSTAGE -- EVENING
Cutter and Olivia are waiting for Angier as he comes off.
OLIVIA
I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making
mistakes.
Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier's coat...
ANGIER
The audience doesn't seem to be
responding much, Cutter.
Cutter puts he LEATHER HARNESS over Angier's arms...
CUTTER
This is a grand theatre with a
sophisticated audience- They've
seen most of these tricks before.
But not this next one. You'll see.
Cutter checks the SPRINGS of the harness and replaces Angier's
coat. He spots a STAGEHAND poking his head around the flies.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
You! Piss off out it!
The dancers are wrapping up.
ANGIER
Wish us luc, Cutter.
CUTTER
(smiling)
I'll have the champagne ready.
Angier, followed by Olivia, steps out onto the stage.
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Angier steps to the table center stage. Pulls out the bird
cage. There are one or two groans from the audience. Angier
SMILES as he produces a DOVE with a FLOURISH.
ANGIER
You've seen this one before?
HECKLER (O.S.)
Seen 'em all before, mate!
Laughter.
ANGIER
Well, I'll make it a little harder,
shall I?
In the wings, Cutter smiles and nods at Angier's showmanship.
43.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Two volunteers, please. A lady and
a gentleman to hold this cage with
me...
Hands go up. Olivia pulls an ELEGANT LADY from the audience.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves or
by any other audience anywhere in
the worth...
Olivi brings Elegant Lady onto the stage along with a REDBEARDED
MAN. The audience is getting interested. Angier is
on role...
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Any magician can make this cage
disappear... that's why I'll ask
this good lady and fine gentleman to
place their hands firmly on the
cage...
Olivia guides Elegant Lady's hands onto the sides of the
cage. Red-beard places a hand underneath the cage.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
...to ensure that no trickery
whatsover is employed.
Angier RAISES the bird cage. The audience is RAPT.
Red beard's other hand appears on the top of the cage- it is
MUTILATED, missing fingers.
Angier FREEZES- looks up at Red Beard... IT IS BORDEN
Borden SMILES as he WORMS his little finger into the cage
mechanism...
SNAP! HALP THE CAGE WHIPS UP ANGIER'S SLEEVE- THE OTHER
HALF COLLAPSES ON THE DOVE AND THE ELEGANT LADY'S FINGERSSHE
SCREAMS- BIRD BLOOD SPLATTERS ONTO THE THREE OF THENTHE
AUDIENCE GOES CRAZYBorden
smiles at Angier through his blood-spattered fake
beard and retreats into the chaos surrounding the Elefant
Lady who is still SCREAMING as Angier tries to free her
fingers from the mechanism.
INT. BACKSTAGE -- LATER
Angier and Cutter watch the STAGEHANDS clear the stage.
ANGIER
I should've spotted him.
44.
CUTTER
You had a lot of plates spinning.
Angier looks down at the harness in his hands.
ANGIER
Don't suppose they'll let us do this
one again.
CUTTER
No.
ANGIER
So what's the climax of our show?
MERRIT (O.S.)
Show? You don't have a show.
ANGIER
Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-
MERRIT
To perform magic- not butcher birds
and break my costomer's fingers!
Clear out, anything here in the
morning gets burned.
Cutter puts his hand on Merrit's arms.
CUTTER
Mr.Merrit-
MERRIT
It's done, John. I've hired a
comedian. You know I hate comedians,
which should indicate the may I felel
about your friend's future as a stage
magician.
Cutter nods. Merrit leaves. Cutter turns to Angier.
CUTTER
There are plenty of good theatres...
if we can come up with another trick
and change the name of the act-
ANGIER
The name stays.
Cutter sees Angier's resolve.
CUTTER
Right. Well, the new trick will
have to be irresistible, then. I've
a couple of methods to try out, but
we'll need a fresh angle on the
presentation.
45.
Angier nods.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
If you need inspiration, there's a
technical exposition at the Albert
Hall this week. Scientists and
engineers. That sort of thing
captures the popular imagination.
EXT. ROYAL ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON
The large concert hall is surrounded by crowds and covered
in banners advertising a Technical Exposition. Angier makes
his way past a giant STEAM ENGINE and into the building.
INT. ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON
THe lobby if filled with displays and models. Angiers pokes
around, looking thouroughly disinterested until he comes to
an information booth plastered with illustrations of
electrical bolts.
TICKET HAWKER
Would you like to know the future,
sir? The man who kill change the
world is speaking right now.
Continents divided no more. Free,
clean power. The mysteries of the
world solved.
The posters show a tall, handsome man bathed in lightning
and standing astride the world like colossus. In bold print
it says:
THE WONDERS OF "ALTERNATING CURRENT"...NIKOLA TESLA
INT. AUDITORIUM, ALBERT HALL -- CONTINUOUS
The hall is completely darkened, but bright blue FLASHES
illuminate ANGIER as he pushes his way to a seat.
On the stage, a tall rod capped with a steel ball is
transmitting a steady, sparking stream of electricity onto a
matched ball across the stage.
A FIGURE walks around from behind the machine and the audience
GASPS as a shower of sparks bounce off of his immaculate
evening wear. This is TESLA- but Angier is too far from the
stage to get a good look at him.
TESLA
With a system like this I could have
the entire city electrified whitin
two years.
The audience breaks into LAUGHTER. The spell is broken.
Tesla must be a lunatic.
46.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Mr. Edison's direct current system
is flawed and dangerous. With my
alternating current devices-
Someone from the audience chimes in:
AUDIENCE MEMBER
(yells)
Fraud.
Angier turns to look. The man who called out is leaving
he's not alone. Angier FREEZES, staring down at aisle-
Borden is sitting there, RAPT, lit by FLASHES from the
machinery on stage. As tesla continues his demonstration,
Angier STARES at Borden.
EXT. STREET -- DAY
Borden walks down the street. Angier is following him.
Borden meets Sarah, pushing a PRAM. Borden looks down at
the baby then up at Sarah.
BORDEN
I love you.
Sarah smiles.
SARAH
See? Today, it's true.
Angier watches Borden kiss wife then his baby.
ANGIER (V.O.)
I saw hapiness...
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT
Angier writing in his leather-bound journal.
ANGIER (V.O.)
...hapiness that should have been
mine. But I was wrong.
Angier glances at Borden's notebook sitting on the desk.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Reading his account I realize that
he never had the life I envied.
Angier flips open the notebook. Staring at the coded writing.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
The family life he craves one minute
he rails against the next, demanding
freedom. His mind is a divided one...
47.
INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY
Borden sits on his cot. Reading Angier's journal.
ANGIER (V.O.)
His soul restless. His wife and
child tormented by his fickle and
contradictory nature...
Borden is crying. He puts the journal down and jumps to his
feet BANGING on the cell door.
BORDEN
Guard! Guard!!
The viewing slot slides open.
GUARD
What do want, Professor?
BORDEN
Paper and pencil. Please.
INT. PRISON LIBRARY, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
Te library is long and titled, with two long tables. It
looks as if it used to be a latrine.
Borden sits at a table. Writing on a stack of notepaper.
His arms have been unbound, but long chains runs from his
ellbows to where Sullen Gaurd sits smoking, craning his nek
to read Borden's writing.
SULLEN
Let me see?
Sullen SNATCHES up the papers. Borden makes no move to stop
him. The top sheet is a sketch of a cabinet.
SULLEN (CONT'D)
I'm going to know all of the
Professor's secrets.
BORDEN
(smiling)
Only if I teach you how to read.
Sullen mashes the papers into a ball and drops them.
SULLEN
Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't
helped you get out of here-
(tugs chains))
Have they? Or can't you open real
locks, Professor?
48.
BORDEN
Perhaps I'm just biding my time.
Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
hand-
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL in front of Sullen's face.
Sullen stares.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
-get you attention. Then quietly
say-
(whispers)
"are you wacthing closely"... perhaps
say a magic word or two... then I'll
be gone.
Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's
feet. Sullebn LAUGHS as Borden SCRABBLEs around his ankles
to retrieve the ball.
SULLEN
How'd you get so famous, then?
Borden STANDS.
BORDEN
Magic.
Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet
to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other
PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.
SULLEN
Oi, Borden, get back here!
Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW. Another
warder CRACKS Borden over the head with a TRUNCHEON. Sullen,
now free, KICKS Borden in the ribs.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON AN ADVERTISSIMENT: "the professor has DEFIED DEATH
to return with a new SPECTACULAR!" Pull wider-
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
A NEWSPAPER on the makeup table. Angier sits at the mirror.
He hubs BROWN PASTE into his hair and then combs it out.
Then he chooses a beard, seats it on his chin and begins to
adjust it. He drops the BOTTLE of spirit gum as he looks in
the mirror and sees OLIVIA standing behind him.
ANGIER
(embarrassed)
I thought you'd gone.
Olivia shifts. Embarrassed.
49.
OLIVIA
I don't really.... have anywhere to
go.
Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
ANGIER
You've been sleeping here?
OLIVIA
Cutter said it would be okay till we
get another booking.
(beat)
What are you doing?
ANGIER
Researching. Part of a magician's
job is to watch his competition, to
see what illusions they're-
OLIVIA
You're going to do something to that
man, aren't you?
Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Cutter's hopig you'll let things
life. He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you then we can-
ANGIER
Even? My wife for a couple of his
fingers? He has a child now. And
he's perfoming again.
(bitter)
Borden is out there, living his life
just as he always intended. As if
nothing had happened. And look at
me. I'm alone. And no theatre will
touch me.
OLIVIA
Us.
Olivia moves towards him.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
You're going to need a better
disguise.
Olivia reaches for Angier's beard.
INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier, almost unrecognizanle as a blonde, slips into the
back of the theatre, which is as rough and unwelcoming as
Borden's last venue.
50.
On the small raised stage, Borden works through his way
through the Chinese rings with GLOVED HANDS to hide his
damaged fingers. The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM.
Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag.
BORDEN
I need a volunteer.
Angier takes a few steps towards the stage.
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL.
he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
As you can see , it's just a rubber
ball. But it's not normal at all.
Angier examines the ball. Hands it back to Borden who shows
no sign of recognizing Angier.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Thank you.
Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing
twenty feet apart on the stage.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
(to audience)
You're not impressed?
Borden BOUNCES the BALL on the ground and catches it.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
It's a magic ball.
Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor. The
audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.
OLIVIA (V.O.)
What happened?
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
Angier still in disguise, is slumped in an armchair, drink
in hand. He is SMILING, remembering.
Olivia, sitting on the workbench, waits for him to continue.
OLIVIA
What happened, Robert?
ANGIER
He had a new trick.
OLIVIA
Was it good?
51.
Angier looks at her...
INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- EVENING
Now it's CUTTER standing in the audience, watching. Onstage,
Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again.
ANGIER (V.O.)
It was the greatest magic trick I
have ever seen.
Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and
crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way.
At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the
door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves
the door open.
He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across
the stage...
Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door.
With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball
continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height...
Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE
happens.
THE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT,
CATCHING THE BALL.
Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden. The audience is
BEMUSED. Finally, a trickle of applause.
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier is talking to Cutter. Olivia is watching.
ANGIER
Did they applaud when you saw it?
CUTTER
Not very enthusiastically.
INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier is disguise, starts CLAPPING loudly, FIRMLY, as if he
can't help it, LEADING the applause.
Borden BOUNCES the ball once again, then BOWS deeply. The
APPLAUSE peters out. Borden walks off the stage.
INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Angier turns to Cutter.
52.
CUTTER
The trick is too good -- too simplethe
audience harly knows what they've
seen.
ANGIER
He's a dreadful magician.
CUTTER
He's a wonderfull magician- he's a
dreadful showman. He doesn't know
how to dress it up, how to sell the
trick.
ANGIER
How does he do it?
CUTTER
He uses a double.
ANGIER
(shakes head)
It's not that simple. This is a
complex illusion.
CUTTER
You think that because you don't
know the method. It's a double who
comes out at the end. It's the only
way.
ANGIER
I've seen his perfom ir three times
now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
same man-
CUTTER
It's not-
ANGIER
The same man comes out of the second
cabinet. I promise you.
OLIVIA
It is the same man.
They both turn to look at Olivia.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
He wears padded gloves to hide his
damaged fingers, but if you look
closely you can tell.
Angier looks at Cutter.
ANGIER
He doesn't know how to sell his trick
to an audience. But I do.
53.
CUTTER
(nods)
It would give us our climax.
ANGIER
The man stole my life. I'm going to
steal his trick.
CUTTER
We'll have to find someone who can
look like you on a stage.
ANGIER
He doesn't use a double-
CUTTER
(impacient)
I don't know how Borden does it,
Robert. So either you wait for Borden
to retire and buy his secret, or you
can listen to how I would do this
trick.
(Angier nods)
Ang the only way I know is to find
you a bloody good double.
Angier smiles. Turns to Olivia, pointing to his face.
ANGIER
Take a good look- let's get out
there and find me.
EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
Angier, swinging his cane, walks slowly up the mountain road.
EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS
The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical
DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower.
Angier stops, fearful.
ALLEY
It's perfectly safe.
As Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center
of the CONFLAGRATION.
Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE,
towards Angier.
54.
TESLA
So this is the Great Danton.
Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he
were on his way to the opera. He brushes SPARKS from the
sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.
Something you did with pockets?
Angier returns the handshake.
ANGIER
I saw a lecture you gave in London,
several years ago. I'm flattered
you agreed to see me.
Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.
Angier, confused, does so. Alley hands him a lightbulb,
which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
What's conducting the electricity?
TESLA
Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite
capable of conducting, and indeed,
producing energy.
Tesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out. Alley takes
it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
EXT. DECK, LABORATORY -- MORNING
Angier, Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl
overlooking a spectacular view. They are eating sandwiches.
TESLA
Alley has explained that you require
a very interesting device.
ANGIER
I need something impossible.
TESLA
You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's
reach exceeds his grasp'?
(MORE)
55.
TESLA (CONT'D)
(off his look)
It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his
nerve. The only limits on scientific
progress are these imposed by society.
Tesla looks out at the mountains.
TESLA (CONT'D)
The first time I changed the world I
was hailed as a visionary. The second
time I was asked politely to retire.
The world only tolerates one change
at a time. And so here I am.
(gestures at laboratory)
Enjoying "retirement".
(looking at Angier)
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.
Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Alley says you are a stage magician.
If a built you this device, you would
be presenting it only as an illusion?
ANGIER
If people thought the things I did
on stage were real, they wouldn't
clap- they'd scream. Think of saving
a woman in half.
Tesla nods. Considering.
TESLA
Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
ANGIER
Price is not an object.
TESLA
Perhaps not. But have you considered
the cost?
ANGIER
I'm noit sure I follow.
TESLA
I can make your machine, Mr. Angier.
But I can also give you some advice...
(pointed)
Go home. Forget this thing. I can
recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley
could tell you, I myself an given to
one now and then. It will not do
you any good.
56.
ANGIER
Have your obsessions done you no
good?
TESLA
At first. But I've followed them
too long- I am their slave. Their
whipping boy. And one day they may
choose to destroy me.
Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
ANGIER
if you understand an obsession then
you know you won't change my mind.
TESLA
(smiles)
So be it.
ANGIER
Will you build it?
TESLA
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the
mountain air. This will take time.
Tesla disappears into the lab.
INT. GREEN ROOM DRINKING CLUB -- EVENING
The club is warm and dark. Olivia, Cutter and Angier make
their way to the bar. Olivia points to the far end of the
bar, to a TRAMP in tattered clothing, curled over a pint.
OLIVIA
(to tramp)
Gerry?
The tramp sees Olivia, hoists himself up and spills his way
down the bar to them. As he draws closer, we understand why
Olivia has brought them here.
Underneath the filth and matted hair, this man is SPITTING
IMAGE of Robert Angier- HE IS PLAYED BY THE SAME ACTOR
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like
you to meet Mr. Gerald Root.
ROOT
A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
Angier is staring a little too much. Root throws an ARM
over Angier's shoulder and draws him in.
57.
ROOT (CONT'D)
(whisper)
Would you like for me to tell you a
little joke?
Angier smiles unconfortably. Sunddely Root WRAPS this hands
around Angier's neck and begins to THROTTLE him.
Cutter breaks it up and pushes Root back.
ROOT (CONT'D)
(yelling)
Are you laughing?
Angier is shaken. Root picks up his hat off the bar and
disappears onto the street.
ANGIER
He's out of his mind.
OLIVIA
He's an out-of-work actor- of course
he's out of his mind.
CUTTER
He's perfect. A little work, mind
you, but when I'm done with him he
could be your brother.
ANGIER
I don't need him to be my brother.
I need him to be me.
EXT. NORTH HILL -- DAY
Borden escorts Sarah and their TODDLER, a girl, up the three
lined street.
Borden stops abruptly. Crouches to his daugther.
BORDEN
Would you like to see a magic trick?
Borden reaches up and pushes a wayward LOCK a her hair over
her ear. When his hands returns, it's holding a KEY.
He stands, places the key in Sarah's hand.
SARAH
What is this for?
Borden takes her gently by the shoulders and turns her around
until she's facing a modest two-story HOUSE. She looks down
at the key in her hand.
58.
SARAH (CONT'D)
When I asked last week you said we
couldn't afford.
BORDEN
You caught me in the wrong mood.
SARAH
But you want through all the-
BORDEN
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my
mind, aren't I? The act is taking
off, maybe soon I'll get us into a
bigger theatre. Things will work.
Sarah turns and embraces her husband.
INT. EMPIRE THEATRE
The auditoruim is empty. Two doors is simple frames have
been erected in the middle of the stage. Angier fiddles
with one, opening it, walking through it. Olivia is watching.
OLIVIA
You walk through this one- then...?
Angier stands Olivia in front of the door.
he pushes the door all way open. Suddenly, a TRAP-DOOR set
into the floor POPS open. Angier JUMPS through it-
INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
Olivia gathers up her skirts and DROPS through the hole-
INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
-LANDING beside Angier on the straw matterss.
OLIVIA
Oof. Couldn't you find a softer
one?
ANGIER
(smiles)
It's not for sleeping on.
Olivia looks around the below stage area.
OLIVIA
And Root goes up through there?
59.
She gestures at a LIFT twenty feet away with a TRAP DOOR
MECHANISM above it. Angier nods. Olivia looks at Angier.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
It's going to be amazing, Robert.
ANGIER
It has to be. Borden's trick is
getting noticed. The place was packed
today.
Olivia looks at him strangely.
OLIVIA
You went and saw his show again?
Angier looks away, embarrassed.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
You becoming obsessed, Robert.
CUTTER (O.S.)
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Robert.
Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door.
INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER
Angier and Olivia sit in the front row. Cutter beckons Root
onstage. He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage
costume. he TRIPS on his way across the stage.
ANGIER
All I have to do is keep myself
stinking drunk all the time and no
one will be able to tell the
difference.
CUTTER
A little faith, sir. Could you favor
us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
Root picks himself up and dusts himself off.
Suddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER. he is channeling everything
from his facial expressions to his walk. Angier nods,
starting to believe this might work. The illusion is PERFECT --
till he opens his mouth.
ROOT
You would drink, too, if you know
the world half so well as I do.
Angier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different
angles. Root starts APING his every movement. Olivia starts
laughing. Angier is getting uncomfortable.
60.
ROOT (CONT'D)
Did you think you were unique, Mr.
Angier? I have been Cassar. I have
been Faust. How difficult could it
possibly be to play 'The Great
Danton?'
CUTTER
You can go back to being yourself.
Root. For free..
Root looks challengingly at both men.
ROOT
I'd rather be him, for now. I find
it amusing.
Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner
that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from
thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia.
CUTTER
Root has to keep a low profile--
anyone sees him the game's up.
ANGIER
(watching Root)
I don't know how you do these things,
Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know.
CUTTER
Have you thought about what we should
call the trick?
ANGIER
No point being coy. Borden calls
his trick 'The Transported Man'?
Cutter nods.
EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE -- EVENING
The enormous MARQUEE of the Empire Theatre:
'The Great Danton perfoms THE NEW TRANSPORTED MAN'
Beneath it, a CROWD. Fallon amongest them. STARING up at
the sign.
INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING
Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING
BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses
them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre.
The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage.
Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the
audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor.
61.
ANGIER
Ladies and gentlemen, much of what
you've seen tonight can be termed
illusions. Entertaining trifles of
the sort you may have seen other
magicians perform.
Angier puts on a TOP HAT.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Alas, I cannot claim this next feat
as illusion. Watch carefully- you
will see no trickery, for no trickery
is being employed. Merely a techique
familiar to certain citizens of the
orient and various holy men of the
Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may
be familiar with this technique, but
for those of you who aren't, do not
be alarmed, what you are about to
see is considered safe...
Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand
door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold.
Then strolls through crossing the stage-
-to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its
solidity, then walking trough the frame.
Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air.
It sails back down to him and he catches it.
Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it
disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear
it's not coming back down.
LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
back down to him. He catches it.
Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it...
The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and
ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT.
BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat.
The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one
in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS.
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw
mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards.
Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS.
62.
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING
Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess.
Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table.
OLIVIA
(toast)
To our achivement.
They drink.
CUTTER
The manager said he's never seen a
reaction like it.
Angier smiles, rueful.
ANGIER
At least he got to see it. I spent
the ovation hidden under the stage.
No one cares about the man who
disappears, the man who goes into
the box. They care about the man
who comes out the other side.
OLIVIA
I care about the man in the box.
Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.
ANGIER
Thank you.
(to Cutter)
Maybe we could switch before the
trick. That way I could be the
Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
CUTTER
(shakes head)
The antecipation of the trick is
everything- it needs your showmanship
to built suspense. If Root opens
his mouth, it's all over- he can't
introduce the trick.
ROOT (O.S.)
of course I can. I'm the Great
Danton.
They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.
CUTTER
Root, you bloody fool, get that
costume and makeup off right now,
anyone could walk in here!
Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet. He grabs his collar
and turns to Angier and Olivia.
63.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
Congratulation, all.
Cutter DRAGS Root out. Olivia slides onto the makeup table.
ANGIER
I suppose I should get more rest.
OLIVIA
Life is not full of these moments,
Robbie.
Olivia pours him some more champagne.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
We've worked hard for this, and we
need to celebrate properly.
Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile. She pulls him
in closer and they KISS. She wraps her legs around him.
They kiss again.
Angier pulls back.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
(softly)
It is your wife?
Angier shakes his head, distracted.
ANGIER
The trick isn't good enough.
Olivia stares at him.
OLIVIA
Didn't you see the audience?
ANGIER
No.
OLIVIA
Well, they loved it.
ANGIER
It's not as good as his trick.
OLIVIA
Borden's trick is nothing compared
to ours. He doesn't have any style-
ANGIER
He doesn't have to spend the finale
hiding under the stage.
Angier rises, turning out of her embrace.
64.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
I need to know how he does it.
OLIVIA
Why?
ANGIER
So that I can do it better.
Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
I need you to go and work for him.
OLIVIA
Work for him? Are you joking
ANGIER
You'll be my spy.
OLIVIA
(taken aback)
We just got our start and you want
me to leave?
ANGIER
It's how we advance.
Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Think of it, Olivia... we've got
people excited about Cutter's version
of the trick- imagine what we could
do with the real illusion. We'll
have the greatest magic act anyone's
ever seen.
OLIVIA
(frustated)
He knows I work for you.
ANGIER
Exactly why he'll want to hire you.
He'll want my secrets.
OLIVIA
Why would he trust me?
Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.
ANGIER
Because you're going to tell him the
truth.
INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
Alley shows Angier in. Tesla is sitting, reading.
65.
TESLA
You must be curious to see what so
much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
Tesla RISES. Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL
MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Fitting that you should be here for
the maiden voyage.
Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the
machine. It RUMBLES into life, smoke pouring from the slats.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Your hat.
Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla.
Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
directly underneath the machine. He returns to the controls.
ALLEY
You might want to stand back.
TESLA
No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley,
please proceed.
Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine.
Nothing happens. Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of
the tripped FLASHES whits hot. BOLTS shooting out of it,
wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod. The CHARGE
reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has
broken the sound barrier.
Suddenly the room is still.
Tesla walks forward. Looks down into the pit.
Alley joins him at the edge of the pit. Angier, limping,
is the last to arrive, locking into the pit-
-at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.
ANGIER
I don't understand-
Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with
CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit.
ALLEY
Perhaps it would be best if you left
us to it. We'll see you next week?
Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door.
66.
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools,
cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden
is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe.
Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her,
turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves.
OLIVIA
(looking around)
Interesting workshop.
BORDEN
We make do.
OLIVIA
My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
BORDEN
I know who you are. Are you here to
steal the rest of my show?
Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the
shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING
NEW TRICK"
OLIVIA
No. I'm here to give your show what
is missing.
BORDEN
And what might that be?
OLIVIA
Me.
BORDEN
(to Fallon)
Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard?
A woman's touch.
Fallon leaves, closing the door.
OLIVIA
I've left Angier. I want a job.
Borden sits there.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
I know you have no reason to trust
me-
BORDEN
Why on earth shouldn't I trust you?
The mistress of my enemy.
Olivia is taken aback. Chanes tack.
67.
OLIVIA
Mr.Borden-
BORDEN
Alfred.
OLIVIA
Alfred. I'm going to tell you the
truth.
BORDEN
Ah. The truth. A slippery notion
in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
OLIVIA
I'm here because he sent me here.
He wants me to come and work for you
and steal your secret.
BORDEN
What does he need my secret for?
His trick is top notch. The Great
Danton vanishes and isntantly
reappears on the other side of the
stage -- mute, overweight, and,
unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking
his bows under the stage?
Olivia meets his gaze.
OLIVIA
No. It's killing him. he's obsessed
with discovering your method. He
thinks of nothing else, and takes no
pleasure in our sucess. I've had
enough. There's no future with him.
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you
his.
BORDEN
He has no secrets from me.
Borden stares at her, unsure.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
And this is the truth?
She gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug.
68.
INT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY
Cutter is fixing a prop mechanism. Angier approaches, in
his undershirt, looks over his shoulder. Cutter glances up.
CUTTER
Best be getting changed for the
martinee, sir.
- Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
ROOT! You're late.
(sniffs)
And even more drunk than usual. Get
yourself below stairs, right away!
ROOT
No.
CUTTER
No?!
Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice.
ROOT
We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY
Angier is applying his makeup. Cutter enters. Angier looks
at him through the mirror.
ANGIER
We have a problem, Cutter.
He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement:
PANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL
DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP
IMITATIONS!!!
ANGIER (CONT'D)
He'll be perfoming right across the
street.
CUTTER
We have a bigger problem. Root.
ANGIER
Don't tell me he fell over again.
CUTTER
Worse. He realized he can make
demands.
ANGIER
He's blackmailing us?
69.
CUTTER
In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to
be honest- it usually takes them a
lot longer to figure it out.
ANGIER
How much does he want?
CUTTER
It makes no difference- we have to
stop doing the trick.
ANGIER
(wields paper)
Stop doing the trick? Look at this.
CUTTER
Look at yesterday's. And last week's,
where they called you "London's
premiere stage performer", not
"magician" mind. Performer. Of any
kind.
ANGIER
What's the point?
CUTTER
My point, Robert, is that you've
climbed too high to get away with
any kind of professional
embarrassament. We're not doing any
tricks we can't control.
Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking.
ANGIER
Pay him whatever he wants, for now.
We keep doing the trick till Borden
opens, then we'll phase it out.
INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- NIGHT
Root smokes a cigarette. PULL BACK to reveal he is standing
on the LIFT beneath the stage...
The trapdoor OPENS and Angier DROPS onto the straw mattress.
He looks over to see Root finishing his cigarette.
ANGIER
(hisses)
Get up there!!
Root smirks at Angier- TOSSES the cigarette and CATAPULTS up-
INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
-onto the stage and STEPS/STUMBLES out from behind the door
to LOUD APPLAUSE.
70.
Root has a SLOPPY GRIN as he STRUTS acroos the stage, milking
the applause from every angle, blowing kisses, winking...
loving it. He turns to Cutter in the wings. Blows him a
kiss.
Cutter GLARES. Then TURNS to a stagehand.
CUTTER
Get it down!
ANGIER (V.O.)
Cutter was always surprised how fast
Root turned bad.
The stagehand starts LOWERING THE CURTAIN.
INT. RESTAURANT, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY
Angier sits with Borden's dairy.
ANGIER (V.O.)
We paid him enough to keep him in
beer- you wouldn't expect him to
rock the boat. Today I learned
Borden's view on the episode...
INT. TAVERN -- EVENING
The bar is dark and seedy, packed with an unpromising lot.
ANGIER (V.O.)
...and his account suggests a reason.
Root is hanging precariously from his barstool, head lolling
towards his empty glass. He is in his own clothes, but
cleaned up to look like Angier.
A full PINT arrives in front of him. Root turns to face his
benefactor- BORDEN. Root takes several large GULPS, staring
at Borden. Suppresses a belch.
ROOT
To what do I owe the pleasure of
this rather welcome pint of ale?
BORDEN
You are the Great Danton, aren't
you?
Root gestures silence, glancing around them.
ROOT
Of course I am. But don't advertise
it- I'll be mobbed with fans.
(grins at Borden)
And who might you be?
71.
BORDEN
Just a humble admirer. And fellow
practitioner.
ROOT
Ah, very good.
Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass
in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK.
BORDEN
Another?
ROOT
If you insist. I'm not perfoming
tonight. Well, only one show, and,
to be frank, my people pretty much
run things these days.
BORDEN
You could probably do it blindfolded.
ROOT
Bloody good idea.
BORDEN
Have it.
ROOT
Thanks.
A new pint arrives. Root sips.
BORDEN
Actually, there's something I might
warn you about.
ROOT
Oh?
BORDEN
Well, it's your Transported Man
illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to
know your method... but I had a
similar trick in my act- and I used...
(looks around,
whispering)
...a double.
ROOT
Oh, I see, very good.
BORDEN
At first. Then it went bad. You
se, I hadn't counted on the fact
that once I incorporated this bloke
into my act, he had complete power
over me.
72.
ROOT
Complete power, you say?
BORDEN
(nodding gravely)
Weel, he was the secret, you see.
And the more successful I became,
the more outrageous his demands
became. He practically backrupted
me. In the end I had to stop
performing the illusion completely.
(looks at Root)
You must be very careful about giving
someone that power over you.
Root looks at Borden. Drunken whells spinning.
ROOT
Thanks for the warning.
INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING
Angier is almost all the way through his act.
ANGIER
...some of you may be familiar with
this technique, but for those of you
who aren't, do not be alarmed, what
you are about to see is considered
safe...
Angier takes his time, confident, MILKING IT. He throws his
HAT into the air, catches it.
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Angier DROPS ten feet to the concrete floor. But there is
NOTHING to break his fall-
He SMASHES painfully to the ground. CLUTCHING his leg in
AGONY, he looks up and sees SOMEONE standing on the lift
twenty feet away... BORDEN.
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The first door slams shut. The audience turns their attention
to second door.
The door remains closed. The HAT falls gently to the floor.
SILENCE, broken by a COUGH in the audience.
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
BORDEN bows to Angier- the LIFT ROCKETS BORDEN UP THROUGH
THE STAGE FLOOR.
73.
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The second door OPENS, and BORDEN steps through, looking all
around, CONFUSED, as if he doesn't know where he is. He
looks back at the door, then picks up the HAT...
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Angier looks at his leg- a nasty COMPOUND FRACTURE. As he
chokes on pain he can hear LAUGHTER from the AUDIENCE.
INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
As Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too
small, something is LOWERED from the flies above:
ANGIER/ROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain. A sign
around his neck reads: "OPENING AT PANTAGE- THE PROFESSOR"
Borden looks up behind him.
BORDEN
Great Danton, I must apologize! I
simply had too much magic for my
stage at the Pantages!
The Great Danton comes to rest three feet above the stage.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Pardon my intrusion!
Borden places the top hat and ANGIER/ROOT at a JAUNTY ANGLE.
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. Borden BOWS, hops down
off the stage, and walks up the aisle, bowing, enjoying it
all the way.
INT. STAGE -- LATER
Cutter crouches over Angier, fixing a LONG SPLINT to his
broken leg. Behind them, Root still hangs above the stage,
groaning in protest.
CUTTER
I don't see how Borden found him- I
had him under wraps, I was careful.
ANGIER
Well, he did.
Cutter helps Angier to his feet.
CUTTER
Sit, do you think it might be her?
Olivia?
Angier stops to look at Cutter.
74.
ANGIER
No. I don't.
Cutter gestures at Root.
CUTTER
Shall we cut him down?
ANGIER
He's the Great Danton. Let him cut
himself down.
EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier, thinly disguised, leg in long metal brace, pushes
through the crowd outside the box office. The marquee: The
Professor Performs His Masterpiece- THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED
MAN!!
On the box office: SOLD OUT THRU SUNDAY. Angier STARES.
SCALPER (O.S.)
Need tickets, sir?
Angier turns to the SCALPER. Nods.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
Angier slumps into a seat at the back of the PACKED theatre.
ONSTAGE: Borden works through his show with a SUPERIOR DEGREE
OF SHOWMANSHIP, even cracking a smile when called for.
Working WITHOUT GLOVES, he makes much of performing tricks
ONE-HANDED. He is assisted by Olivia, who looks STUNNING.
Borden performs ths Transported Man. Borden HAS DRESSED IT
UP WITH ELECTRICAL APPARATUS. Two large glass balls transmit
SPARKS between one cabinet and the other along BARE WIRES.
Another watches, anger rising as he watches Olivia's close
RAPPORT with Borden.
INT. APARTAMENT -- EVENING
Olivia enters in to the darkness bedroom. She strikes a
match and lights one of the gaslights...
...and SCREAMS as the gaslight illuminates Angier, sitting
in an armchair, cane leaning against the arm of the chair.
ANGIER
You weren't expecting me?
OLIVIA
I was expecting you sooner, Robbie.
Your message said "afternoon".
75.
ANGIER
Well, it takes a bit for me to get
around these days...
Angier RAPS his leg brace with his cane. HOISTS himself up.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
He's taken everything from me. My
wife, my career... now you.
OLIVIA
What do you mean? You sent me to-
Angier takes her by the shoulders, ROUGHLY.
ANGIER
I sent you to steal his secret- not
to improve his act-
OLIVIA
That's my job-!
ANGIER
Or to fall in love with him!
OLIVIA
You abandoned me to him!
Angier SLAPS her. She shakes her head at him.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
I did everything you asked.
ANGIER
(challenging)
Yes? Then how does he do it?!
OLIVIA
Cutter was right- it's a double.
Angier shakes his head, furious.
ANGIER
Of course Borden said that-
OLIVIA
He didn't say anything- he'd never
say. I've seen things- make-up,
glasses, wigs. We don't use any of
it for the show, but I've found it
hidden backstage.
ANGIER
(scorn)
It's misdirection- he leaves those
things lying around to make you think
he's using a double.
76.
OLIVIA
All the time? He doesn't know when
I'm looking-
ANGIER
All the time, Olivia- that's who he
is, that's what it takes- he lives
his act, don't you see?!
(beat)
And just because you're sleeping
with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
Olivia glares athim, tears forming in her eyes.
OLIVIA
You thing you can see everything,
don't you?
She moves to her bed, REACHING below the mattress.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
But the Great Danton, is a blind
fool.
Olivia tosses something at Angier: a CARDBOARD-BOUND NOTEBOOK.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
His notebook.
Angier starts leafing desperately through pages.
ANGIER
You stole it?
OLIVIA
I borrowed it for tonight. I thought
you'd be able to translate some of
it, but now I realize-
ANGIER
I can't.
OLIVIA
(scorn)
You can't.
ANGIER
Olivia, no one could-
(studies pages)
It's a cypher- with a transposition
that probably shifts every day of
the diary. Even with the keyword it
would take months to decode...
OLIVIA
And without the keyword?
77.
ANGIER
Perhaps never. We'll see.
Angier puts the cardboard-bound notebook into his pocket.
Olivia, worried, holds out her hand for the notebook.
OLIVIA
No, we won't- if I don't get that
back tomorrow morning, he'll know I
took it.
Angier looks at her, incredulous.
ANGIER
You can'r possibly think I'd let
this go? This is his diary, Olivia.
All of his secrets are right here,
in my hands.
OLIVIA
(pleading)
Don't do this do me, Robert!
ANGIER
(shrugs)
Leave him.
OLIVIA
He knows where I live!
ANGIER
I need to know his method.
OLIVIA
(desperate)
It won't get your wife back, Robert.
ANGIER
I don't care about my wife- I care
about his secret!
Angier stops, realizing what he said. Calms himself.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Look, I'll go to his workshop and
stage a break-in-
OLIVIA
He'll know it was you-
Angier puts his hands GENTLY on her shoulders.
ANGIER
Yes, me, not you. Understand?
Olivia nods, crying. Still scared. Angier drags his leg to
the door. She watches him go, torn.
78.
OLIVIA
Robert? I have fallen in love with
him.
Angier looks at her, sympathetic.
ANGIER
Then I know how hard this had been
hard for you.
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
CLOSE ON: SHATTERED GLASS, BROKEN PROPS AND CABINETRY.
Borden and Fallon survey the WRECKAGE of their shop. Borden
looks at Fallon.
BORDEN
Notebook.
Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Then he's just getting started.
EXT. STAGEDOOR, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
A small CROWD of autograph SEEKERS crowd the stagedoor. A
BODYGUARD steps through the door and begins unshering them
away as Fallon and Borden follow him through the door.
The bodyguard hold the door to a carriage open and Fallon
steps up. Borden stops at the door.
BORDEN
I'm walking tonight, gentlemen.
Fallon looks concerned.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Let him come. I don't care.
Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street.
Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and
pulls out a PISTOL. He checks that it's loaded and slips it
into his own jacket. Then he sets off after Borden.
EXT. STREETS, WEST END -- EVENING
Fallon continues to follow Borden at a distance. Borden
steps into a tobacconist's. Fallon stops and idles at the
street corner.
As Fallon watches, acrooss the street, another man STOPS.
Fallon slips back around the corner and looks:
It's Angier, leaning on his cane.
79.
Borden emerges from the tobacconist and continues down the
street, a cloud of pipe smoke drifting after him.
Fallon waits for Angier to set off after Borden, then follows
both men from a distance.
Borden crosses to the same side of the street as Angier.
Fallon picks up his pace and tries to cross the street but
is HELD UP for a second by passing traffi.
As he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees
Angier dissappear down and alleyway.
EXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS
Fallon rounds the cornder and stops. The alleyway is EMPTY. --
he has lost them. Finally, he sees an open, darkned doorway
towards the end of the alleyway.
INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
Fallon stops at the doorway, his gloved hand gripping te
doorframe.
Angier stands at the other end of the hallway, watching him.
Fallon takes a step towards him and CRASHES through the rotten
floor to the basement below.
INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Fallon drops heavily into an almost-vertical OPEN COFFIN.
DISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses CUTTER DROP THE LID INTO
PLACE, shutting him in. Cutter starts NAILING it down.
A GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box. Cutter falls
back, but is caught by Angier.
Angier rolls Cutter off to one side. He is clutching at a
BLOODY WOUND on his arm.
CUTTER
I'll live.
(to coffin)
You save me the trouble to making
you an air hole!
Angie picks up the hammer and continues NAILING.
EXT. HIGHGATE CEMETARY -- MORNING
Borden picks up his way through the overgrown cemetary. He
hears a KNOCKING and turns:
Angier is behind him, RAPPING on a broken headstone with the
head of his cane.
80.
BORDEN
I'm impressed.
ANGIER
Why's that?
BORDEN
You're finally getting your hands
dirty. This is what a good trick
costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
ANGIER
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all
going to be yours. Unless you give
me what I want.
BORDEN
Which is?
ANGIER
Your secret.
Borden tries to gauge Angier's expression.
BORDEN
My secret?
ANGIER
Your method for the Transported Man.
Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact,
he doesn't talk at all.
BORDEN
(shrugs)
You have my notebook.
ANGIER
Useless without the keyword.
Angier pulls a sheaf of writing paper and a pencil stub from
his pocket. He offers them to Borden.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Write down your method Mr. Borden.
Describe it in full.
Borden takes the paper and pencil and stares Angier in the
eye, gauging him.
Beat.
Borden writes a SINGLE WORD on the top page and folds it up.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
I want the method not the keyword- I
don't even know if the secret is in
you notebook.
81.
Borden looks at Angier with a glint in his eye.
BORDEN
The keyword is the method.
Angier reaches for the folded paper, which Borden lifts out
of reach.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Where is my ingeneur?
Angier pulls a SHOVEL free from a pile of dirt beside him.
He STAKES it into a fresh pile of dirt in front of Borden.
Borden looks at Angier, CONCERNED.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Is he
Angier plucks the folded paper from Borden's hand.
ANGIER
How fast can you gid?
Angier movies away through the headstone, leaning heavily on
his cane. Borden begins to DIG.
INT. HOSPITAL -- EVENING
Cutter is slumped in a chair by the wall, his arm bandaged.
He smiles up at Angier, who sits down next to him.
ANGIER
How's the arm?
CUTTER
Still attached. Did you get your
answer?
Angier holds up the folded paper.
ANGIER
Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked
yet, I wanted you to share this.
Cutter looks curiously at Angier.
CUTTER
I already know how he does it, Robert.
The same way he always has, the same
way we do. You just want it to be
something more.
Angier looks at Cutter, uneasy.
ANGIER
Well, let's find out, shall we?
82.
Angier opens the piece of paper. A large GRIN spreads across
his face. he turns it to Cutter- it reads-
- T E S L A -
Cutter frowns, confused.
CUTTER
What does it mean?
ANGIER
(excited)
It means, Cutter, that we have a
journey ahead of us. To America.
Cutter watches Angier's excitement. Awkward.
CUTTER
Robert, listen to me.
(gentle, but definite)
Obssession is a young man's game, I
can't follow you any farther in this.
Angier looks at Cutter, uncomprehending. He considers saying
something. Stops. Restraining himself.
ANGIER
Then the rest is up to me.
INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT -- EVENING
Sarah sits by herself at a table for two. Borden ENTERS
with a swagger, Olivia beside him, Fallon behind. The MAITRE
D' hurries over, signaling WAITERS. Sarah looks up.
UNCOMFORTABLE.
SARAH
I didn't know we'd be joined for
dinner.
BORDEN
Absolutely. We're celebrating.
The Waiters spirit another table and chairs to join Sarah's.
Borden pulls out a chair for Olivia.
SARAH
Miss Wenscombe. Mr.Fallon.
Olivia smiles cheerfully. Fallon nods, embarrassed.
BORDEN
(to wine waiter)
Champagne. Your finest
SARAH
What are we celebrating, dear?
83.
BORDEN
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?
OLIVIA
What trick, Freddy?
SARAH
(brittle)
Yes, "Freddy". What trick?
The WAITER presents a bottle of champagne. Borden nods
without looking at it.
BORDEN
(loud)
I'm going to bury myself alive.
Every night. Then someone's going
to come along and dig me up!
OTHER DINERS are glancing over. The waiter uncorks the bottle
with a muffled POP and pours champagne into Borden's glass.
SARAH
(to waiter)
I'm not sure my husband needs-
BORDEN
Who are you to tell me what?!
Awkward silence. Olivia shifts in her seat.
OLIVIA
Perhaps-
SARAH
Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort
Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's
being a bore. I see no reason for
the two of you to suffer as well.
Fallon is on his feet, pulling back Olivia's chair.
OLIVIA
Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night,
Freddy.
They leave. Borden glares at his wife.
SARAH
"Freddy"?
BORDEN
It's my name.
SARAH
Not at home.
84.
BORDEN
I'm not always at home.
Sarah is clearly on the verge of tears.
SARAH
Alfred, why are you being like this?
Borden, seeing her fistress, softnes.
BORDEN
Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today.
I thought I'd lost something very
precious to me.
SARAH
What?
Borden looks at her speechless. Shrugs helplessly.
SARAH (CONT'D)
I see. More secrets.
BORDEN
Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our
life.
Sarah brushes away a tear.
SARAH
When you're like this, Alfred, I'm
not seeing the real you. You're
treating me like your audience.
Performing. I can't live with that.
Borden just sits there. Offering nothing.
EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY
Angier walks up to the hotel. A MOTORCAR is parked in front
and TWO MEN are unloading it. One of the men STARES at Angier
as he enters the hotel.
INT. CLIFF HOUSE INN
Angier walks to the reception desk.
ANGIER
I thought I had the place to myself.
MANAGER
Unexpected guests.
(looks out the window
at the men)
Not very polite. A lot of questions.
At first I thought they might work
for the government.
85.
ANGIER
No?
MANAGER
(lowers voice)
Worse. They work for Thomas Edison.
Angier starts out the windo at the men unloading equipment.
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- CONTINUOUS
Angier sits at the desk, deciphering Borden's diary.
BORDEN (V.O.)
Today, a most curious development...
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Borden turns to see Fallon show in Olivia.
BORDEN (V.O.)
His assistent come to us with a
proposition...
They start to speak as Borden's V.O. continues.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Obviously Angier has sent her, and
told her to admit as much...
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking
his bows under the stage?
Olivia meets his gaze.
OLIVIA
No. It's killing him. He's obssessed
with discovering your method. he
thinks of nothing else, and takes no
pleasure in our success. I've had
enough. There is no future with
him. He sent me here to steal your
secrets, but I've actually come to
offer you his.
BORDEN
He has no secrets from me.
Borden stares at her, unsure.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
This is the "truth" you spoke of?
She gives him a sly smile.
86.
OLIVIA
No. This is what he told me to tell
you.
Beat.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
The truth is that I loved him. And
stood by him. And he sent me to you
like he'd send a stagehand to pick
up his shirts.
(looks him in the eye)
I hate him for that.
They sit there in silence, appraising each other.
BORDEN
I can spot Angier's methods from the
back of the theatre. What could you
possibly have to offer me?
Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand.
Borden flinches, surprised.
OLIVIA
You may know he does his tricks...
but you can't understand why no one
can see that yours are better.
She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his
mutiladed hand.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
You hide this. I had to look closely
to spot it when you performed the
Transported Man.
(looks into his eyes)
But this makes you unique... it shows
the audience that you aren't using a
double; You musn't hide it, you
must display it proudly...
(looks at hand)
I'm sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand.
BORDEN
(quietly)
It does.
OLIVIA
Then let people know. You can be so
much more then he is. I can show
you how.
Borden looks into her eyes.
BORDEN (V.O.)
I think she is telling the truth.
87.
INT. BEDROOM, BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT
Borden and Olivia are in bed together. It is raining outside.
He watching her get out of bed and moves to the window to
smoke a cigarette.
BORDEN (V.O.)
I think we cannot trust her. But I
love her. I need her. We need her.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
How could he send you away? He must
be blind, deaf and dumb.
She smiles quietly at this.
OLIVIA
Robbie's blinded by his jealosy.
He'd do anything for you secret.
Sending me away was the least of it.
Borden considers this.
BORDEN (V.O.)
Trust is not the point- love is the
point... who have we ever trusted?
To open myself to such a relationship,
EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY -- DAY
Olivia makes her way past crowed MARKET STALLS.
BORDEN (V.O.)
...to the dangers of such an affair...
I need assurances of fidelity. Of
love.
Fallon is SHADOWING her from a distance.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But how to be sure when truth is
layered like the skin of an onion?
I know a way... she must help me rid
ourselves of Angier. It is the only
way to kow her mind.
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY
Angier looks up from Borden's diary. Pale. He flips pages
and pages forward TO THE LAST ENTRY...
BORDEN (V.O.)
Today my mistress proves her
truthfulness. Not to me, you
understand.
88.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I have been convinced since she led
me to Root... today, Olivia proves
her love for me to you, Angier.
Angier looks up from the notebook. Mind reeling.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Yes, Angier. She gave you this
noteboook at my request. Yes, she
led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is
merely the key to my dairy, not to
my trick. Did you really think I
would part with my secret so easily
after so much? Good-bye, Angier,
may you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in yout American home.
Angier STARES at the pages, unblinking. JUMPS to his feet...
INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
Angier STRIDES up to the fence.
ANGIER
TESLA!
(nothing)
TESLA!!
Angier takes his cane and starts running its METAL TIP across
the eletrified fence- causing SPARKING and CRACKLING.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
ALLEY, GET OUT HERE AND LET ME IN!!
Alley emerges from the building, consufed.
INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
Alley opens the door- Angier BURSTS IN past him, ENRAGED.
ANGIER
I've veen played for a fool!
ALLEY
Who by?
ANGIER
Tesla never made a machine like the
one I asked for.
ALLEY
We never said he had.
ANGIER
You let me believe that he had, Alley!
(MORE)
89.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
You stole my money because your
funding was cut off- you've been
shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along while you
use my money to stave off ruin.
I've seen Edison's men-
ALLEY
Where?
ANGIER
In the hotel. I've every mind to
bring them up here myself-
TESLA
That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
Tesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT.
TESLA (CONT'D)
It is true, sir, that you are your
one remaining financier. But we
have not stolen your money...
ALLEY
Sir, my cat?
Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE.
ALLEY (CONT'D)
When I told you I could make your
machine I spoke the simple truth.
Science is just a name for the art
of rendering the exotic mundane. It
has no boundaries- its very purpose
is to destroy boundaries.
ANGIER
Then why isn't the machine working?
Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles.
TESLA
Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is
not an exact science. The machine
simply does not operate as expected.
It needs continued examination.
ANGIER
Where did my top hat go?
ALLEY
Nowhere.
Alley points to the top hat, which is sitting on a workbench.
90.
ALLEY (CONT'D)
We've tried the damn thing a dozen
times. And the hat went nowhere.
TESLA
Which is why we need to rey a
different material. It may provoke
a different result.
Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
TESLA (CONT'D)
You don't expect me to handle the
thing myself?
Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the
TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the
animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.
ALLEY
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, Doctor.
Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the
generator.
The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES.
Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large
BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the
unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then
sputters out.
Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit.
Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there,
still tied to the hook.
Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car.
Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of
Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab.
ANGIER
I'll go.
Angier limps after the cat.
EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS
Angier sees the cat disappearing along the edge of the
building and into the forest beyond.
Angier follows.
EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS
Angier pushes his way through the dense undergrowth, trying
to keep up, but the cat has disappeared.
91.
ANGIER
Here, kitty, kitty.
Suddenly, a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier. He begins
to follow the noise.
He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten
feet across.
Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier.
He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing
one. The other cat RACES off.
Angier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at-
TOP HATS. Clustered in a small glads. The first cat slinks
its way through them.
The SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into
the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the
woods beyond-
Angier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of
dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS.
EXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY
The top hats are in a pile on the dark. Tesla is at the
table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers. Angier
and Alley are watching.
ANGIER
So the machine was working?
ALLEY
I never bothered to check the
calibration. The hat never moved.
TESLA
These things never quite work as you
expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's
one of the principal beauties of
science.
Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands. It has a
tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim. He picks up another
hat. It has the same TEAR.
TESLA (CONT'D)
We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
out the-
(looks at hats)
-problems with the machine. I'll
send word when it's ready.
Angier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door.
92.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Don't forget your hat.
Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
ANGIER
Which one is mine?
TESLA
They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.
Tesla smiles at him.
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Borden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and
tries to hop up into his lap. Laughing, he helps her up.
JESS
Are we going to the zoo this
afternoon, daddy?
BORDEN
Daddy's got some business this
afternoon.
JESS
But you promised.
BORDEN
Did I?
Jess nods at him, solemly.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Then go to the zoo we shall.
Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
(gestures to newspaper)
Who's that?
A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The
Professor- England's premiere magician!
JESS
That's you, daddy?
Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands.
BORDEN
Daddy has some errands to run. I'll
be back before you know it, so get
ready.
Borden walks to the door. As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding
his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her.
93.
She reaches for the sherry decanter. He watches her pour.
Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying.
SARAH
We each have our vices.
Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes.
BORDEN
Sarah. Whatever you may think, your
only competitions for my affections
is my little girl. I love you. I
will always love you, and you alone.
She looks into his eyes. Fascinated.
SARAH
You mean it today.
BORDEN
Absolutely.
SARAH
That makes it so much harder when
you don't.
She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves.
EXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON
Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal
that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city.
Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for
him -- Fallon.
Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it.
BORDEN
More shopping. She doesn't like the
smell of money, doesn't she?
Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
The little lady wants to visit the
Zoo, I thought you could take her.
I'll do it tomorrow, if not.
(looks at his feet)
Sarah... she knows. At least, she
knows things aren't right.
(looks at Fallon,
pleading)
Help me with her. Try and convince
her that I love her. Please.
Borden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes
off down the path. Fallon sets off in the opposite direction.
94.
INT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT
Olivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to
Borden. She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss,
but he backs away.
OLIVIA
What is it. Freddy?
BORDEN
Please don't call me that. It's
nothing, just... sometimes things
seem... wrong.
Olivia looks at him. Cold.
OLIVIA
Freddy, I've told you before. When
you're with me, you're with me.
Leave your family at home where they
belong.
BORDEN
I'm trying, Olivia. Please.
OLIVIA
I'll get dressed.
Borden watches her move down the hall.
OLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I saw Fallon hanging around my house
again, after you left.
Olivia comes back in, half-dressed.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
There's something about him I don't
trust.
BORDEN
You trust me?
(off her look)
Then trust Fallon- he protects the
things I care about.
EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING
Angier walks out from the lobby. The two MEN he saw before
are loading up their automobile. Smiling, laughing.
EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING
The coach pulls to a stop. Angier and the driver look up.
A plume of SMOKE is rising from further up the hill.
95.
EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MOMENTS LATER
Angier rounds the bend in the road and comes into view of
the laboratory. He FREEZES.
The fence has been TORN DOWN. Beyond it, the LAB has been
BURNED TO THE GROUND. The metal tower is in SMOLDERING
PIECES. Everything else is gone.
Angier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him,
and, using his cane, flips it over. It's Alley's sign warning
trespassers to keep out.
INT. ANGIER'S ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- EVENING
Angier takes down the picture of Julia from the mantel. He
studies it a second then puts it in the top of his packed
suitcase.
INT. LOBBY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING
The BELLBOYS wrestle with Angier's cases as Angier walks to
the reception desk. The manager smiles up at him.
MANAGER
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.
Angier takes out his wallet and begins laying down bills.
MANAGER (CONT'D)
We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave
as well. He was very good to Colorado
Springs. A very generous man.
Angier smiles up at him, absently and begins to leave.
MANAGER (CONT'D)
Mr. Angier?
(Angier turns)
I didn't feel it was necessary to
tell the other men about the box.
Angier stops.
ANGIER
What box?
The manager smiles.
INT. HALLWAY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING
Angier follows the manager down a darkened hallway.
MANAGER
We never use these rooms in the off -
season. It's a shame.
96.
The manager stops at a set of DOUBLE DOORS and unlocks them.
He pushes them open and ushers Angier through.
INT. BALLROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS
Angier steps into the massive, elegant room.
Standing on the dance floor is an ENORMOUS SHIPPING CRATE.
Stencilled on one side "COLORADO SPRINGS"
Angier walks up to the huge crate, awestruck.
An envelope addressed to him has been stuck to the front.
Angier stops it and begins to read.
TESLA (V.O.)
My dear Angier, you will find what
you were looking for in the box. I
apologize for leaving without saying
goodbye...
EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK
Under cover of night, a group of FIGURES ransack the
laboratory.
TESLA (V.O.)
But I seem to have outstayed my
welcome in Colorado.
The figure begin setting FIRE to the sides of the laboratory.
TESLA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The extraordinary is not permitted
in science and industry. Perhaps
you'll have more luck in your field,
mystified. As to the use of the
machine...
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
The open crate sits empty at the side of a derelict stage.
Angier, in shirt sleeves is running cables to the MACHINE,
which is standing center stage.
TESLA (V.O.)
Alley has written you a thorough set
of instructions. I add only one
suggestion on using the machine-
EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK
Alley holds open the door to a coach. Tesla steps up into
it and looks back from the coach's open door, up the mountain.
97.
TESLA (V.O.)
-Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.
High on the mountain, the laboratory is ABLAZE.
TESLA (CONT'D)
Such thing will only bring you
misery.
Tesla folds himself into the coach, shutting the door as it
moes off down the mountain.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier moves to one side of the stage where he makes a hash
mark with a piece of chalk.
ANGIER (V.O.)
Tesla's warning is as unheard as he
knew it would be. Today I tested
the machine...
He loads A GUN and places it next to the machine.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Taking precautions in case Tesla
hadn't ironed out the kinks in its
operation...
Angier THROWS THE SWITCH. The machine GROANS into LIFESPARKING
and GLOWING as it gets up to full power.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...if it went wrong I would not want
to live like that for long...
Angier closes his eyes for an instant, listening to its power,
then THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE MACHINE. HE IS CONSUMED BY
LIGHT...
WHITE SCEENANGIER
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
But here, at the Turn, I must leave
you, Borden...
The WHITS becomes handwriting an a page and we are-
INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY
Borden STARES at Angier's journal in disbelief.
ANGIER
Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in
your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting
your death. For my murder.
98.
Borden SLAMS the journal shut. Staring at it.
EXT. PRISON CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
BORDEN stands at the fence again.
OWENS
Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that
you'd reconsidered his offer.
BORDEN
Angier's journal, the "gesture of
good faith"? It's a fake.
OWENS
(surprised)
I assure you it's not.
BORDEN
It has to be- it refers to events
that happened after his death.
OWENS
Clever predictions, I'm sure. The
provenance of the journal is clear
and under no doubt. It's written in
Angier own hand, of which we have
numerous examples.
(looks at Borden)
What makes you think it's a fake?
Borden looks away, uncomfortable.
BORDEN
It doesn't matter.
Borden leans forward and stuffs ROLLED PAPERS through the
fence. Owens takes them carefully.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
My tricks. All of them.
OWENS
Including the Transported Man? Lord
Caldlow will be very pleased.
BORDEN
No he won't. They're not completeyou
only have the Pledge and Turn
for each.
Owens leafs through the papers, annoyed.
OWENS
Without the Prestige for each trick
these are wothless.
99.
BORDEN
You'll get the rest after you bring
my daughter here.
Owens looks at Borden.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
I want to say goodbye.
INT. BORDEN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Jess sits at the foot of the stairs, listening to her parents
SHOUT at each other in the living room. She is CRYING.
BORDEN (O.S.)
Stop it! Just stop it!
SARAH
Deny it all you want- I know!
INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Sarah is WILD, eyes red, hair a mess. Utterly DISTRAUGHT
Borden is trying to calm her.
BORDEN
Sarah, it's not true! I've told you
Olivia means nothing to me!
SARAH
I'll go yo her! I know what you
really are, Alfred!
BORDEN
(quietly firm)
Sarah. You can't do that.
INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Jess looks up. Fallon is standing above her. Listening.
SARAH (O.S.)
I'll do what I have to!
Jess reaches up a hand. Fallon takes it in his.
BORDEN (O.S.)
Sarah, you can't talk like this!
INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Sarah turn to face Borden. Deperate.
SARAH
I can't live like this!
100.
BORDEN
(angry)
What do you want from me!
Sarah pauses. Catches her breath.
SARAH
(quiet)
I want you to be honest with me. No
tricks, no lies, no secrets.
Borden calms. Looks into her eyes. Nods.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Do you love me?
Borden looks into her eyes. Sincere.
BORDEN
Not today.
Sarah takes this in. Borden watches, helpless.
SARAH
(whispers)
Thank you.
Borden watches her turn away from him.
INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Jess reaches up to Fallon with her other hand. He takes her
gently in his arms. We stay on Jess's tear-stained face
over Fallon's shoulder as he carries her up the stairs.
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING
CLOSE ON A POSTER: Borden, in costume, looking intense: THE
PROFESSOR- MASTER OF DARK FORCES. As we PULL BACK we hear a
GENTLE CREAKING...
PULL BACK past a hanging PAIR OF FEET, one shoe missing...
wider shows up that it is SARAH, HANGING BY HER NECK FROM A
BEAM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP. Gently swinging.
INT. PUBLIC HOUSE -- NIGHT
Cutter is finishing his meal at the bar. He goes to take a
swig from his pint and FREEZES- at the bottom of the glass:
A PLAYING CARD. He looks around the bar. No one he
recognizes. He reaches into the glass.
Cutter pulls out the card- an ADDRESS is written up one side.
EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Cutter walks along labyrinthine streets. Stops at an
ABANDONED THEATRE. He looks up at the building, then enters.
101.
INT. ALBERT HALL -- EVENING
Cutter makes his way past the tattered box office and into
the derelivt auditorium.
In the middle of the room is the CRATE. Cutter stands and
stares at it.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Who's there
Cutter turns. A STAGEHAND. His eyes are solid white. The
man is clearly BLIND.
CUTTER
I- I'm looking for an old friend-
ANGIER (O.S.)
I heard about a booking...
Cutter turns. Angier is behind him, leaning on his cane.
Beside Angier is a SECOND BLIND STAGEHAND.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Nice little theatre. Good up-andcoming
magician.
CUTTER
You came back.
ANGIER
It's a good to see you, John.
Cutter sizes Angier up. Looks around the theatre.
CUTTER
Good rehearsal space. Blind
stagehands. I like it-
(knowing smile)
You always had an eye for publicity.
Angier sits in one of the stalls. Cutter follows suit.
ANGIER
I need your help, John. My last
show. A limited engagement.
CUTTER
Your last show?
ANGIER
A wise man once told me that obsession
was a young man's game. I'm almost
done. One thing left...
(points at crate)
The real Transported Man.
Cutter stares at the crate.
102.
CUTTER
You want to design a show around it?
ANGIER
i don't want you backstage, I need
you front of house, managing.
Cutter considers this. Uncertain.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
i need you calling in any favours
and connections you have left to get
us the right booking for the run.
CUTTER
What sort of booking are you after?
ANGIER
The sort that Borden can't ignore.
Cutter looks at Angier. Nods.
EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- DAY
A long, expensive CARRIEGE creeps out to a halt outside the
abandoned theatre, and the confused driver pulls over.
DRIVER
This is the address, sir.
The carriage opens, an imposing man in his 50's steps out,
looks the place up and down, then heads inside.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
The man enters the auditoruim and stares downat the BRIGHTLY
LIT STAGE.
Cutter moves quickly up the aisle, hand outstretched.
CUTTER
Mr.Ackerman. It's an honor to see
you again, sir.
Ackerman shakes Cutter's hand.
ACKERMAN
When you said you only wanted to
show me one trick it piqued my
interest.
CUTTER
It's a very special trick.
Mr.Ackerman.
Angier has appeared.
103.
ANGIER
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.
ACKERMAN
Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on,
shall we?
Angier smiles.
CUTTER
(down to stage)
Turn it on, please.
After a moment, the machine SPARKS INTO LIFE. ELECTRIC BOLTS
CASCADE from the GLOBE and SPLASH on the stage.
ACKERMAN
Very pretty.
Angier smiles at Cutter and head back down the stage. he
STEPS himself into the machine and DISAPPEARS.
The machine SPUTTERS out and is silent.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
That's it, Cutter? He simply
disappears? That's not a trick. He
has to come back. There has to be a-
VOICE (O.S.)
-a Prestige?
ACKERMAN
Exactly-
Ackerman begins to turn around- then STOPSANGIER
IS STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM.
Ackerman is dumfounded. He looks back down at the stage.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
(quiet, haunted)
Pardon me. It's very rare to see...
real magic. it's been many years
since I've seen...
Anckerman steadies himself;
ANGIER
Are you interested in helping us?
ACKERMAN
(nods)
Yes. But you'll have to dress it up
a little. Disguise it. Give them
enough reason to doubt it.
104.
INT. STAGE MANAGER'S OFFICE, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY
Merrit sits eating a sandwich. The door to his office opens
and ACKERMAN strides in. Merrit STRUGGLES to his feet.
MERRIT
(surprised)
Mr. Ackerman. When they said...I
didn't think you'd be here in person.
Ackerman sits without being asked to.
ACKERMAN
I have an act for your venue.
MERRIT
(flustered)
Well, of course, sir...But I'm afraid
I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet.
They're playing through next year.
ACKERMAN
Get rid of them. This is a magical
act. An excellent one. I believe
you booked his first engagement
several years ago. The Great Danton.
MERRIT
You really want me to-
Ackerman stands.
MERRIT (CONT'D)
I'll do it. Of course.
Ackerman picks up a pen and paper from Merrit's desk.
ACKERMAN
(smiles)
There will be one hundred
performances. No more, no less.
Five perfomances a week. No
matinees, no weekends.
Ackerman scribbles onto the paper and hands it to Merrit.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
(smiles)
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.
Ackerman sweeps out of the room, leaving Merrit dumbfounded,
staring at the scrap of paper in his hands.
INT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING
Olivia and Borden are seated across from each other, finishing
their meal. Olivia watches Borden eat.
105.
OLIVIA
You haven't spopken about her, Freddy.
Not once.
BORDEN
Who?
OLIVIA
Don't be cruel.
BORDEN
Why would I talk about her to you?
OLIVIA
Because she was part of your life
and now she's gone.
Borden says nothing.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
She wanted to meet me the day before
she killed herself. Said she had
something to tell me about you.
(looks away)
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring
myself to face her.
(looks at Borden)
What would she have said, I wonder?
BORDEN
(snaps)
You want the truth about me, Olivia?
(she nods, wary)
I never loved Sarah.
OLIVIA
(appalled)
You married her, had a child with
her-
BORDEN
Part of me loved her. But part of
me didn't. The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here now. I
love you. That is the truth that
matters.
Olivia tosses her napkin on her plate.
OLIVIA
You could be sitting in some other
restaurant talking to some other
woman about me that way. It's unhuman
to be so cold.
Borden watches her rise from the table. She looks at him.
106.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
By the way, have you seen who's opened
at the Pantages?
(Borden shakes head)
The Great Danton.
BORDEN
He's back?
OLIVIA
After two years. And he has a new
trick. They're saying it's the best
that London's ever seen.
Borden cannot hide his reaction.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
If you could see the look on your
face, Professor. You should go to
him- you deserve each other.
Olivia smiles at him and leaves.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
Borden, in disguise, takes his seat halfway along the aisle.
The lights dim. Curtains RISE on a simple stage. Bare except
for a WATER-FILLED GLASS TANK.
Borden STIFFENS in his seat, perplexed.
Angier limps onto the stage. Addresses the audience.
ANGIER
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick
of the evening is one that involves
considerable risk.
(removes his coat)
Anyone in the audience who would be
irrevocable damaged by seeing a man
drown should leave now, for when I
tell you that the young lady who
taught performing it, you will
understand the seriousness of the
danger involved.
Borden watches the hook descend from the flies. Remembering.
INSERT CUT: Borden STARES as Angier desperately BRUSHES the
water from Julia's face.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- LATER
Angier steps forward as another curtain is drawn up behind
him, revealing TESLA'S MACHINE.
107.
ANGIER
In my travels I have seen the future,
and it is a strange future indeed.
The world is on the brink of new and
terrifying possibilities.
The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and
BOLTS fly from it. SMOKE drift over the audience.
Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front
of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity
behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps
into the machine.
The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine
and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs.
Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost
impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but,
just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S
BODY FALLING THROUGH A TRAP DOOR.
The machine sputters out. Angier has DISAPPEARED. The lights
are dim. A FOLLOW SPOT FIRES into the BOXES, audience looks
up with a gathering commotion-
ANGIER IS STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE ROYAL BOX, thirtyfeet
above stalls. He smiles down at the audience.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Man's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION!
The audience breaks into a MASSIVE STANDING OVATION.
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Fallon is at the workbench, staring at a sketch of Tesla's
machine. Borden paces, AGITATED.
BORDEN
Why only 100 performances? Do his
methods dictate it, or is it simply
a publicity move?
Borden walks back and stares at the sketch.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Fifty yards in a second. And all I
know is that he uses a trapdoor.
What's going on under that stage?
EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT
The theatre is closed, and tree BLIND STAGEHANDS are
wreastling a TARP-WRAPPED BOX onto a cart in the alleyway
behind the theatre.
Fallon is watching from the shadows.
108.
EXT. LABYRINTHINE STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Fallon shadows the cart as it slowly makes its way.
EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- LATER
Fallon watches from further down in the alley as the Blind
Stagehands unload the box onto a dolly and wheel it through
the stage door.
He moves closer, then STOPS. Seeing something. CUTTER has
emerged from a nearby doorway and slipped through the stage
door.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
The blind stagehand wheel the tarp-covered box to two LARGE
METAL DOORS in the floor of the auditorium and start hooking
it up to a winch. The metal doors open with a metal HOWL...
Cutter slips down the aisle. WATCHING.
BLIND STAGEHAND
WHO'S THERE!
The man turns precisely to Cutter, flasing his white eyes.
CUTTER
It's Cutter.
BLIND STAGEHAND
What do you want?
CUTTER
I'm looking for Angier.
ANGIER
You found him.
Cutter turns. Angier approaches.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
I told you, John- I don't want you
backstage on this one.
CUTTER
What are they doing?
ANGIER
Disposing of the Prestige materials.
Cutter looks down at the BLACK HOLE in the floor.
CUTTER
What's down there?
Angier looks at him, serious.
109.
ANGIER
Do you really want to know?
Cutter considers Angier's grave tone.
CUTTER
Perhaps not.
Cutter leaves by the stage door.
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY
Borden sits at his work bench. Fallon fiddles with his howler
hat.
BORDEN
They do this every night. After
each performance?
Fallon nods. Borden gets to his feet with a sigh. Turns to
a POSTER on the wall- "The Great Danton Perform THE REAL
TRANSPORTED MAN- 100 SHOWS ONLY"
He studies the image of Angier. There is a small DEVIL
looking over his shoulder.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
We're done.
(turns to Fallon)
Let him have this trick. You're not
to go back there. I don't need to
know his secret. Leave him alone.
Fallon puts on his hat with a shrug.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING
A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED
MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air. IT IS
BORDEN.
A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle. He
shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down
towards the stage...
On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling. Looming
over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE. Borden
STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage.
Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the
vast machine. As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various
features of the metal and glass apparatus.
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers to the side of the
stage, Borden slips through the gas at the side of the
curtains110.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
-looks around, disoriented, then darts for some stairs leading
below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND.
STAGEHAND
Where'd you think you're going?
Borden pulls off his beard.
BORDEN
I'm part of the act, you fool!
The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden
RACES down below the stage. Cutter approaches the Stagehand.
CUTTER
Who was that?
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Angier throws switches on his machine. As it GROANS into
life, SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier gares at it, forgetting
his audience. Entraced. Possessed.
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He
GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE
EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the
Stagehand's face. He is BLIND. Borden moves on.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT
Angier, facing the audience, steps backwards into the machine.
He looks up at the electricity sparking just above him.
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Borden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS
TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITS LID PROPPED OPEN. Borden frowns.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
BOLTS of electricity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball
of LIGHTING which CRACKSINT.
BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The ROOM fills with lIGHT as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a
BODY DROPS INTO THE TANK. The lid of the tank and trapdoor
above SNAP SHUT, leaving the tank, and Borden, in complete
DARKNESS.
111.
INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The Machine sputters to a stop. Angier is GONE. The audience
sits, WAITING.
INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- NIGHT
Borden the tank, ANGIER IS DROWING. His rolling EYES fixed
on Borden, he POUNDS desperetely on the thick glass, SCREAMING
BUBBLES...
Borden, HORROFIED, tries forcing the lif ot the tank open.
It's sealed shut. He leaves the tank and begins searching
around under the stage. He finds a SPANNER.
Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank,
which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY.
WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into
Borden, and both of them onto gournd.
Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto
his side and POUNDS on his back. Water and blood OOZE from
the man's lungs. His eyes are dilated and lifeless:
ANGIER IS DEAD.
Borden is frozen, unable to move.
Cutter appears behind him, SHOCKED by what he sees. Borden
turns to look at him, his eyes wild with confusion.
CUTTER
What did you do?
INT. MORQUE -- EVENING
A MORTICIAN pulls back a sheet draped over a CORPSE.
Angier's lifeless eyes stare up at us. Cutter looks at
Angier, the up at the Mortician. Nods.
JUDGE (V.O.)
Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert
Angier...
INT. COURTROOM -- DAY
borden stands chained to the dock. The JUDGE has a piece of
black cloth draped over his wig.
JUDGE
You will, in one month's time, be
hanged by the neck until dead. May
the Lord have mercy on your soul.
112.
INT. EVIDENCE ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY
A POLICEMAN shows Owens into the room, walking him past all
of the equipment to the far end where Cutter stands staring
at the MACHINE'S CRATE.
OWENS
Mr.Cutter?
(Cutter turns)
Owens.
They shake hands.
CUTTER
Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens.
It's fallen to me to dispose of
Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at
the manifest, it's cleat that Lord
Caldlow has purchased the bulk of
the items.
OWENS
Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know
where to deliver the items you surely
could have just-
CUTTER
It's not just that, Mr.Owens. There
is a particular item
(turns to crate)
This time, in fact, that I wish to...
well, that is to say, I want to-
OWENS
You wnat to buy it instead.
CUTTER
I suppose so, yes.
Owens moves closer to the crate. Sees the COLORADO SPRINGS
stencil.
OWENS
This is the machine?
(off look)
I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about procuring this particular item.
CUTTER
Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord
Caldlow in person.
OWENS
Out of the question, I'm afraid.
Cutter nods. Owens starts to walk away. Turns.
113.
OWENS (CONT'D)
of course, I suppose... if, in the
course of your delivery arrangements
your paths were to cross... I can't
stop you from speaking your mind.
Cutter nods.
INT. CONDEMNED MAN'S CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING
Borden is sitting quietlt in a large cell.
Sullen opens the door.
SULLEN
(sardonic)
Still here, Borden?
Borden looks up.
BORDEN
For now.
SULLEN
Got a visitor. Lord Caldlow. With
a little girl.
Borden HURRIES to his feet.
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
Borden, clutching an envelope, is escorted across the yard,
PEERING at the fence. He catches a glimpse of this daughter
waling beside a man on the wooden section.
As Borden reaches the fence he CROUCHES to greet his little
girl, forcing the Sullen and the other Warder to crouch to
undo his chains.
BORDEN
Jess, how are you?
Jess SMILES at him and reaches through the fence.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Are you alright?
She nods.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
I've missed you. Fallon's missed
you. We both have.
Borden drinks in her gace, her hair. She grasps the fence.
JESS
Can I come in there, Daddy?
114.
BORDEN
Everything's going to be okay.
It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER.
He rises to come face-to-face with Lord Caldlow-
BORDEN (CONT'D)
You must be Lord-
-who is ROBERT ANGIER. Risen from the dead.
ANGIER
(English accent)
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have
been.
Borden STARES at Angier.
BORDEN
I saw you die.
Angier just SMILES.
ANGIER
They flatter you with all those
chains, Alfred. Don't they know you
can't escape without your little
rubber ball?
Borden says nothing.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
All I wanted to do was prove that I
was the better magician. But you
couldn't leave me alone.
BORDEN
You were always afraid to get your
hands dirty...
(looks down at his
Jess)
Not anymore.
ANGIER
No. Not anymore. And I win. Because
no one cares about the man in the
box, the man who disappears.
BORDEN
You win. But don't take my little
girl...
Angier looks at Borden. Bitter
ANGIER
I know how hard it is to have someone
so precious taken away, don't I
(MORE)
115.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
Borden? But you can't take her with
you know, can you? She'll be looked
after. Good-bye, Professor.
Angier gently pulls Jess back from the fence. She PROTESTS
Desperate, Borden holds out the envelope.
BORDEN
Wait. Don't you want this? You
paid for it.
ANGIER
Your secret.
Borden nods. Angier steps up, takes the envelope.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
You always were the better magician,
Borden. We both know that.
HE TEARS the envelope in half. Then again. And again...
ANGIER (CONT'D)
But whatever your secret was, you'll
have to agree-
He tosses the peices on the ground.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
(victorious)
-mine is better.
Angier TURNS.
BORDEN
Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please.
Angier stops. Lets Jess come to fence. She is crying.
JESS
When are you taking me home, Daddy?
BORDEN
Soon. I promise. Soon.
ANGIER
For God's sake, Borden.
BORDEN
Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.
Here-
Borden PRODUCES his RUBBER BALL. Jess looks at it.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
I promise.
116.
Borden VANISHES the rubber ball. ANgier pulls Jess back
from the fence and starts walking away. Borden rises.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
You think this place can hold me,
Angier?
Angier continues walking Jess away. Shaking this head.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Angier!
Borden is alone. He watches as the wind scatters the pieces
of his prestige over the muddy yard.
EXT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE -- EVENING
Angier steps out of an ornate carriage with Jess.
INT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE -- EVENING
Angier steps inside with Jess. The HOUSEKEEPER comes to
take her.
HOUSEKEEPER
Come here, love.
(to Angier)
Sir, there's gentleman waiting.
Angier looks at her, surprised.
INT. DRAWING ROOM, COUNTRY ESTATE -- CONTINUOUS
Cutter is in the drawing room, looking at the carriage clock
on the mantle. Angier enters. Cutter spots his reflection.
CAPTAIN
Dead God.
ANGIER
Hello, Cutter.
CUTTER
You're alive.
(Angier nods)
You're Lord Caldlow.
(Angier nods again)
How?
ANGIER
(shrugs) *
I learned an American accent from-
CUTTER
(Angry)
How are you alive, Robert?! I saw
you on the slab, for God's sake.
117.
Angier fixes Cutter with a steady gaze.
ANGIER
I magician never reveals his secrets.
The Housekeeper appears with Jess at her side.
HOUSEKEEPER
Go on, child.
Angier smiles kindly at her.
ANGIER
Good night, Jess.
They leave.
CUTTER
Who's the girl?
Angier says nothing.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
I've seen her. I've seen her in
court with Fallon...
Cutter, realizing, looks at Angier, SHOCKED.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
(quiet)
What have you done?
ANGIER
She needs looking after-
CUTTER
She needs her father, but you're
letting him hang. And I helped you.
Cutter moves to the door. In a daze. Pauses.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
I came here tonight to beg Lord
Caldlow to let me destroy that
machine. But I won't beg you for
anything.
ANGIER
You don't have to. I'm going to
make sure the machine. is never used
again.
(shrugs)
A good magician never repeats his
tricks.
118.
Cutter considers this. Makes a decision.
CUTTER
Then, Lord Caldlow, where would like
me to deliver it?
ANGIER
My theatre. It belongs with the
Prestige materials.
Cutter lookd at Angier. Sad.
CUTTER
I once told you about the sailor who
described drowing to me...
ANGIER
(nods)
He said it was like going home.
CUTTER
I was lying. He said it was agony.
Cutter opens the door. Angier watches him go.
EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING
Borden is at the fence. Fallon is on the other side.
BORDEN
We go alone now- both of us. Only I
don't have as far to go as you.
Borden looks down at his feet.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
You were right. I should've left
him to his damned trick... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for so many things. For
Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her.
Fallon wipes tears from his face. Borden looks at him.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Don't cry. Not for me. Go live
your life in full. For both of us.
Borden pulls the RUBBER BALL from his pocket and BOUNCES it
up and down. He TURNS to be led back into the prison,
DROPPING the ball.
The ball bounces gently past the fence. Fallon catches it.
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING
Borden is led along the empty corridor, braced by six guards.
119.
The procession stops at a large windowless metal door, sunk
deep into the wall. Sullen opens the door and Borden is led
inside. As Borden passes Sullen he leans in to his ear-
BORDEN
(quiet)
Are you watching closely?
Sullen stares back at him, terrified.
INT. DEATH CHAMBER, NEWGATE PRISON -- CONTINUOUS
The room is low and small. Two parallel beams, eight feet
high, run from one wall to the other. Hanging from the center
of the beams is a chain. Below the chian is a trap door.
Sullen locks the door to the chamber.
EXT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE -- DAY
Jess is playing in the grounds. A NURSEMAID some distance
off chats to a GARDENER.
Jess looks up from playing. Someone is there. Cutter.
EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING
A CART pulls up to the side of the theatre.
Cutter and two WORKMEN step down from the cart and move to
the back of it. Cutter pulls the tarp off the back of the
cart. Underneath it is the MACHINE's CRATE.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING
The crate is sitting on the dolly in the auditorium.
CUTTER
Thank-you gents.
WORKMAN
Where do you want it?
CUTTER
Don't worry. Someone's coming to
help.
The workmen levae. Cutter looks at the crate.
Angier emerges from the darkness.
INT. DEATH CHAMBER
The warders remove Borden's chains and shackles and replace
them with strong leather belts that bind his feet together
and his hands to his sides.
They shuffle him forward onto the trapdoor.
120.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier and Cutter load the crate onto a platform suspended
by a rope. Angier pulls open the two metal doors sunk into
the floor.
Cutter begins turning a WHICH, lowering the crate into the
HOLE. Angier indicates a pile of bricks and a bag of sand.
CUTTER
I'm bringing this over after we're
done.
ANGIER
Cautions as ever, Cutter. No one's
going to use the place. I own it.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING
Angier slowly climbs down a ladder from the hole to join
Cutter in the darkness below.
Cutter is standing next to the platform and the crate. The
only night comes from a LANTERN Angier is carrying. We can
see only a small flicker of the high moldy walls of the
cellar, but it is a large open space.
CUTTER
No room left- you couldn't have
acommodated 100 performances.
ANGIER
It's a good thing I retired early
then.
Angier puts the lattern and his cane on the lif of the crate
and the two men heft ir off the platform.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
We'll put it down the end.
Angier and Cutter move into the darkness with the crate.
From the small pool of light afforded by the lattern, we can
see that they are navigating their way through a large space
filled with LARGE GLASS BOXES.
They arrive at the end and set the crate down.
CUTTER
I'll go mix the cement.
Cutter looks at Angier, cold.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
Take a minute to consider your
achiviement.
Cutter turns.
121.
ANGIER
Cutter, I tried not to involve you.
Cutter looks at Angier. Nods. Then disappears into darkness.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER
Cutter comes across the stage and up through the auditorium.
Fallon is coming in the other direction.
As they pass they nod gravely at each other.
INT. DEATH CHAMBER, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
Borden is held in place by the trapdoor by two warders. The
HANGMAN walks up behind him and attaches a NOOSE to the chain
hanging above Borden. He slips the other end of the noose
over Borden's neck. Positions it under Borden's jaw.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS
Angier is alone bather in the lgiht of the lantern. He turns
to the nearest glass box and smoothes a hand along its face.
ANGIER
(whisper)
No one cares about the man in the
box.
Behind him, a NOISE.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
(calling)
Cutter?
No responses.
INT. DEATH CHAMBER, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY
They WRDEN looks at Borden.
WARDEN
Alfred borden, on this day, in the
name of the King and the high court
of England, you will meet your end.
Do you have anything to say for
yourself.
Borden saus nothing. The Warden gestures to the HANGMAn who
begins to PULL the lever.
BORDEN
(whisper)
Abacadabra.
The trap DROPS from under Borden and he FALLS into the room
below. His rope SNAPS to a halt122.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier PEERS down the row of glass boxes with the lantern.
ANGIER
(tense)
CUTTER?
Angier FREEZES. He can hear a small THUD, THUD, THUD getting
closer, approaching from the darkness...
Angier FLINCHES as a RUBBER BALL bounces into the light-
Angier DROPS his cane to CATCH the ball. He turns it around
in his hands, confused.
Light EXPLODES around him as a GUNSHOT rings out.
Angier stands for a moment, confused, staring at the ball,
then COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching at his stomach.
Fallon's BOWLER HAT breaks into the circle of light. he is
holding a smoking pistol...
Angier drops the ball and it rolls across the floor, coming
to rest at Fallon's feet. But it is not Fallon's gloved
hand that picks up the ball-
-it is a MUTILATED HAND, WITH 2 1/2 FINGERS MISSING. Angier
looks up:
ALFRED BORDEN REMOVES THE BOWLER HAT AND TAKES A BOW.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
(weak)
You- you died.
Borden shakes his head.
Realization sweeps over Angier like a nightmare.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
A brother. A Twin.
INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- FLASHBACK
Fallon DROPS into the coffin. As fallon stares up at us, WE
SEE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, SOMETHING FAMILIAR IN HIS FACE --
FALLON IS REALLY BORDEN IN DISGUISE.
ANGIER
You were Fallon. The whole time...
Fallon/Borden's face disappears as Cutter seals his coffin.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE
Borden smiles.
123.
BORDEN
We were both Fallon. And we were
both Borden.
Angier considers this. Minds spinning.
ANGIER
Were you the one who went into the
box-
INT. STAGE -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK
As the ball bounces acroos the stage, Borden steps into the
cabinet, shutting the door behind him.
ANGIER (V.O.)
-or the one who come back out?
Borden steps out of the second cabinet and catches the ball.
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK
A stagehand wheels the two stage cabinets into the dressing
room and leaves. Borden holts the door after him.
BORDEN (V.O.)
We took turns. The trick is where
we would swap...
Borden opens the first cabinet and pulls up the false bottom.
His TWIN BROTHER, in indentical stage clothes, uncurls himself
from the hidden compartment and hauls himself out.
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- LATER -- FLASHBACK
Fallon and Borden are seated at the makeup table. Fallon
begins removing pieces of his costume and makeup and handing
them to the other brother. As we watch, THEY SWITHC
INDENTITIES.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING
Angier stares up at Borden. Appalled.
ANGIER
Cutter knew. But I told him it was
too simple. Too easy.
BORDEN
Simple, maybe. But not easy.
INT. WORKSHOP -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK
Both Bordens are standing at the workbench. One brother is
gripping the other by his wrist and placing a CHISEL on his
finger.
124.
He checks the placemen of the chisel against his own mutilated
fingers, adjust the chisel's position, them picks up the
hammer.
BORDEN (V.O.)
Nothing easy about two men sharing
one life.
The second brother SWIGS from a gin bottle, then BITES down
a padded stick as the first brother BRINGS DOWN THE HAMMERINT.
CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING
Borden stares at his mutilated hand clasping the rubber ball.
ANGIER
What about Olivia? And your wife?
BORDEN
We each loved one of them. We each
had half a full life. Enough for
us, but not for them.
Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price
of a good trick.
Borden looks down at Angier with contempt.
BORDEN (CONT'D)
But you wouldn't know anything about
that, would you?
Angier is dying. He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice
is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him.
ANGIER
(very quiet)
I've made sacrificies.
BORDEN
It takes nothing to steal someone
else's work.
ANGIER
It takes everything.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK
Angier stands in front of Tesla's machine. Loading the
pistol. He places the pistol by the machine...
Angier takes off his jacket and steps towards the HISSING
machine. BOTLS curl themselves around him.
ANGIER HURLS HIMSELF INTO THE LIGHT.
125.
This time we do not cut away.
The machine sputters out.
ANGIER IS STILL STANDING BENEATH IT.
ANGIER
(confused)
It didn't work.
VOICE (V.O.)
Yes it did.
Angier turns...
ANOTHER ANGIER is standing on the chalk hashmark, STEAM rising
off his shoulders.
The first Angier lunges for the pistol and levels it at the
second Angier.
SECOND ANGIER
(horrified)
No, wait! I'm the-
BANG! BANG! The firt Angier FIRES TWO SHOTS and, grimfaced,
drops the pistol. SHOCKED. He stumbles back, in a
daze, clothes still steaming.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier looks down, a slight smile on his face. He gestures
to the lantern.
ANGIER
(weaker)
Do you want to see what it cost me?
You didn't see where you are, did
you? Let me show you.
Angier slumps to the floor as he tries to reach for the
lantern. He can't his hand to obey him.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
It took courage to climb into that
machine every night...
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK
A drowing tank, identical to the one we have already seen.
A blind stagehand sits behind it, smoking.
ANGIER (V.O.)
Not knowing if I'd be the Prestige....
Suddenly, a trap door flashes open as Angier falls from the
stage door and SPLASHES into the tank. The lid snaps shut.
126.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Or the man in the box...
Angier pounds on the glass, frantic. The blind stagehand
continues smoking. Oblivious.
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY -- FLASHBACK
Two hands SLAM shut on the lid of a birdcage.
The blind stagehand are wrestling a LARGE CRATE onto a cart
in the alleyway behind the theatre.
INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Angier stops trying tomove and leans back, resigned.
BORDEN
(scorn)
You went halfway around the world.
You spent a fortune. You did terrible
things... and all of it for nothing.
Angier looks up at him with his last spark of competitiveness.
ANGIER
Nothing? You never understood, id
you? Why we did this?
(coughs)
The audience knows the truth- that
the world is simple. Miserable.
Solid all the way through. But if
you could fool them, even for a
second, you could make them wonder.
Then you got to see something very
special...
(coughs, looks up)
You really don't know?
Borden just stares at Angier. Who smiles.
ANGIER (CONT'D)
It was the look on their faced.
Angier's body TOPPLES over, KNOCKING over the lantern. Borden
steps back as the oil spreads, flamming, fro the lantern.
CUTTER (V.O.)
Every magic trick consists of three
parts, or acts...
Borden watches Angier for a moment, then turns to leave.
127.
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
The workshop from the opening of the film. We now recognize
it as Borden's. Cutter performs the bird cage trick for the
Little Girl we now know as Jess.
CUTTER (V.O.)
The first part is called the Pledge.
Cutter is showing far the canary.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
The burning lamp oil SPREADS LIGHT through the cellar...
CUTTER (V.O.)
The second part is called the Turn.
I take the ordinary something...
Angier lies in his pooling blood.
Angier's eyes move around, looking at the shapes around him
increasing illuminated by the hellish light...
INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY
Cutter WHIPS the shawl away- cage and bird have disappeared.
CUTTER (V.O.)
But you wouldn't clap yet.
Jess stares, EXPECTANT. Cutter hols up his handkerchiefcovered
hand...
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Because making something disappear
isn't enough...
Cutter whips the handkerchief from his hand, revealing a
canary. Just then, Jess SEES something and JUMPS off the
chest, running past him...
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You have to bring it back.
BORDEN IS IN THE DOORWAY- JESS LEAPS INTO HIS ARMS. Borden
holds her tight. Looks at Cutter, who is putting on his
coat. Nods. Cutter leaves.
Borden reaches into his pocket and hand Jess his rubber ball.
She smiles, then buries her head in his neck.
128.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT
Borden STOPS at the ladder. He notices the shadows from the
burning oil playing on the walls...
CUTTER (V.O.)
Now you're looking for the secret...
Borden turns slowly to look back into the cellar, PEERING
into the flickering light of the burning lamp oil.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
But you won't find it...
Borden stares back into the cellar. What he sees puts a
look on his face that is beyond words:
LARGE GLASS TANKS. DOZENS OF THEM. ROW AFTER ROW STRECHING
INTO THE CAVERNOUS CELLAR.
CUTTER (CONT'D)
...because you don't really want to
know...
FLOATING IN BACH AND EVERY TANK, DRESSED IN ROTTING STAGE
CLOTHES, IS YET ANOTHER ROBERT ANGIER.
INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- DAY
Cutter spreads MORTAT on the last BRICK of the wall he has
built in the opening to the cellar.
He places the brick in the wall, sealing it up.
EXT. FOREST -- DAY -- FLASHBACK
A cat slinks its way through a pile of top harts, knocking
one over as it disappears into the forest beyond.
CUTTER (V.O.)
...you want to be fooled.
We are left alone in the glade, staring at the top hats-
FADE OUT.

           Harvey Dent was needed. He was
           everything Gotham has been crying
           out for. He was...a hero. Not the
           hero we deserved - the hero we
           needed. Nothing less than a knight,
           shining...

                         
          The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice.
          The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates...

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent.

                          GORDON
           But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his
           friend. And it will be a very long
           time before someone inspires us the
           way he did.
          Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his
          eulogy.
           I believed in Harvey Dent.
          And we FADE TO BLACK.

          Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are -

                         

          INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY

          Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third
          Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man.

                         

          EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

          An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
          fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
          stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
          Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
          vehicle.
          The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
          Man.

           2.

                         

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
          Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
          briefcase.

                         

                          DRIVER
           He wasn't alone.
          CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
          Pavel.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You don't get to bring friends.

           DR. PAVEL

                          (SHAKEN)
           They are not my friends.

                          DRIVER
           Don't worry, no charge for them.

                          CIA MAN
           Why would I want them?

                          DRIVER
           They were trying to grab your
           prize. (Smiles.) They work for the
           mercenary. The masked man.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (EXCITED)
           Bane?
          The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

          The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed.
          CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.

                          CIA MAN
           What are you doing in the middle of
           my operation?

           3.

                         
          Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
           The flight plan I just filed with
           the Agency lists me, my men, and
           Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
           you.
          CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
          1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

                         

                          CIA MAN

           FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON
           MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)

           SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.

           PAVEL?!

                         
          Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
          Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

                          CIA MAN

           HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO

           TRY NEXT?!

                         
          The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

                          CIA MAN

           TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE

           WEAR THE MASK?!

                         
          The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
          man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

                          CIA MAN

           LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

                         

           THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)
           Or he's wondering why someone would
           shoot a man before throwing him out
           of an aeroplane.

                         
          CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

                          CIA MAN
           Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
           talk. Who are you?

                         

                          THIRD PRISONER
           We are nothing. We are the dirt
           beneath your feet. And no one cared
           who I was until I put on the
           mask...

                         
          CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
          hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
          eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

           4.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Who we are does not matter. What
           matters is our plan.

                          CIA MAN

                          (FASCINATED)
           If I pull this off, will you die?

                          BANE
           It would be extremely painful.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You're a big guy -

                          BANE
           For you.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (UNNERVED)
           Was being caught part of your plan?

                          BANE
           Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
           offer in favor of yours. We had to
           know what he told you about us.

           DR. PAVEL
           Nothing! I said nothing!

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Why not just ask him?

                          BANE
           He would not have told us.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You have methods.

           Him, I need healthy. You present no
           such problem.
          CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
          tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.

          The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
          looming over it, dangerously close...

          The plane lurches. The noise is building.

           Sir?

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Well congratulations, you got
           yourselves caught. What's the next
           step of your master plan?

          The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on
          tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each
          side...

          The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane

                          (RISING)
           With no survivors.
          A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
          outside the window. Bang -

          Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach
          grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start
          to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted,
          unnaturally.

          Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms,
          legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
          Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's
          neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
          plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
          Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
          him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

                         

                         

          EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

          The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
          helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.

          Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then
          opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting
          gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down,
          by Dr. Pavel.

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
          swinging out as the tail explodes.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
          Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
          A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
          seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
          the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

                         
          Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
          surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
          runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
          horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,
          drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the
          body...

                         
          An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
          out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.

           7.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Friend. They expect one of us in
           the wreckage.
          The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.

                         

                          HOODED MAN 2
           Have we started the fire?

                          (NODS)
           The fire rises.
          Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
          Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
          Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.

                         

                          BANE
           Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
           fear...
          Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
          vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

                         

                          BANE
           That comes later.
          Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
          them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.
          Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,
          and we -

          Drifting over the vast city...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent Day may not be our
           oldest public holiday...
          ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           But we're here tonight because it's
           one of the most important...
          ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...

           8.

                         

                         

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
           against organized crime and, yes,
           ultimately, his sacrifice, have
           made Gotham a safer place than it
           was at the time of his death, eight
           years ago...
          ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
          addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.

                         

                          MAYOR
           This city has seen a historic
           turnaround. No city is without
           crime. But this city is without
           organized crime because the Dent
           Act gave law enforcement teeth in
           its fight against the mob. Now
           people are talking about repealing
           the Dent Act. And to them I
           say...not on my watch.
          Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
           I want to thank the Wayne
           Foundation for hosting this event.
           I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
           tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
           in spirit...

                         
          High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Now I'm going to give way to an
           important voice...

                         
          Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
          sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Commissioner.

                         

                          GORDON
           Congressman.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
           these things?
          Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
          cuts in.

           9.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           No one has. Not in years.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           He can tell you about the bad old
           days, when the criminals and
           corrupt ran this town with such a
           tight grasp that people put their
           faith in a murderous thug in a mask
           and a cape. A thug who showed his
           true nature when he betrayed the
           trust of this great man - (Turns to
           picture of Dent.) And murdered him
           in cold blood.
          The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
          grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Sweetheart, not so fast with the
           chow.

                          MAID
           (turns, tight smile)
           Shrimp balls?
          The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
          Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
           about Harvey Dent...

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
           We're gonna be here all night.

                          GORDON
           Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
           so simple, Congressman.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           But I'll let him tell you himself -
           Commissioner Gordon?
          Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
          speech. Thinks.

                          GORDON
           The truth...?

          Gordon's son with a handgun.

          Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
           I have written a speech telling the
           truth about Harvey Dent...
          Gordon folds up his speech.
           Maybe the time isn't right...
          Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
          mutters under his breath.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Thank Christ for that...

                          GORDON
           Maybe right now all you need to
           know is that there are a thousand
           inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
           direct result of the Dent Act.
           These are violent criminals,
           essential cogs in the organized
           crime machine that terrorized
           Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
           all I should say about Harvey
           Dent's death is this...it has not
           been for nothing.
          The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
          People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
          Foley.

                         

                          GORDON
           The second shift reports in?

                          FOLEY
           On your desk. But you should put in
           some more time with the Mayor -

                          GORDON
           That's your department.

                         
          Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Anyone shown him the crime stats?

                          FOLEY
           He goes by his gut, and it
           continues to bother him, whatever
           the numbers.

                          CONGRESSMAN

           Not really. She took the kids and
           moved to Cleveland.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           He'll have plenty of time for
           visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
           spring.

                          FOLEY
           Really? He's a hero.

           Mr. Wayne is as determined to
           ignore important things as trivial
           ones.

           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Don't take it personally, Miranda.

                         
          They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.

                          DAGGETT
           Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
           there with eight-inch nails, peeing
           into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
           of you to let me on the grounds.

                          ALFRED
           The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
           Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
           always a pleasure.
          Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.

           13.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Why waste your time talking to the
           man who threw away your investment
           on some save-the-world vanity
           project? He can't help you get your
           money back. But I can.

                          MIRANDA
           I could try explaining that a
           save-the-world project, vain or
           not, is worth investing in,
           whatever the return. I could try,
           Mr. Daggett, but you understand
           only money and the power you think
           it buys, so why waste my time,
           indeed?

                         
          She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
          Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
          He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
          something. He slowly limps into the next room...

                         

          INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
          Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
          target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
          bow. Picks up his cane.

                          MAID
           I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
           It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

                         
          Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.

                          MAID
           Although you don't have the long
           nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
           scars...
          She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.

                          WAYNE
           Is that what they say about me?

           14.

                         

                          MAID
           It's just that...nobody sees you...

                         
          Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

                          WAYNE
           That's a beautiful necklace.
           Reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother. It can't be the same
           one - her pearls are in this safe -
          He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau, revealing a safe door...
           - which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable.

                         
          ...which swings open with an awkward creak.

                          MAID
           Oops. No one told me it was
           uncrackable.

                         
          The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

                          WAYNE
           I'm afraid I can't let you take
           those.

                         
          She smiles at him. Moves towards him.

                          MAID
           Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
           more than I would beat up a
           cripple.
          She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
           Of course, sometimes exceptions
           have to be made.

                         
          The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
          He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

                         

          EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
          white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
          pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
          slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAID
           Can I have a ride?
          The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           You read my mind.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER


                         
          Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.

                          ALFRED
           Miss Tate was asking to see you
           again.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's very persistent.

                          ALFRED
           And quite lovely, in case you were
           wondering.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I wasn't.

                          ALFRED
           What are you doing?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Examining print dust. We've been
           robbed.

                          ALFRED
           And this is your idea of raising
           the alarm?

                          WAYNE

                          (SHRUGS)
           She took the pearls. Tracking
           device and all.

                          ALFRED
           She?

                         

                          WAYNE
           One of the maids, perhaps you
           should stop letting them in this
           side of the house.

           16.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps you should learn to make
           your own bed, then. Why are you
           dusting for prints?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not. She was.

          Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
          to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.

           YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
           Sir?

                         
          A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.

                          BLAKE
           I didn't want to bother you up
           here, but they're looking for you.

                         

                          GORDON
           What's the problem, son?

                          BLAKE
           Congressman Gilly's wife's been
           calling. He hasn't made it home
           from the Wayne Foundation event.

                          GORDON
           That's a job for the police?

                          BLAKE
           Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
           I've only logged half a dozen
           arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
           the streets you cleaned 'em good.
           Pretty soon we'll be chasing
           overdue library books.
          Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.

                          BLAKE
           But here you are. Like we're still
           at war...

                          GORDON
           Old habits.

           17.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           Or instinct.

                          GORDON
           What's your name, son?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, sir.

                          GORDON
           You have something you want to ask
           me, Officer Blake?

                          BLAKE
           It's that night. This night, eight
           years ago. The night Dent died.

                         

                          GORDON
           What about it?

                          BLAKE
           The last confirmed sighting of the
           Batman. He murders those people,
           takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
           Dent's neck...then just vanishes?

                          GORDON
           I'm not hearing a question, son.

                         
          Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you want to know who we was?
          Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
          his fingers across its rusted shell.

                          GORDON
           I know exactly who he was. (Turns
           to Blake.) He was Batman.

                         
          Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Let's go see about the

          Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne?
          Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.

                         

                         

          INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.

          Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
          lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
          a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
          where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.

                         

                          ALFRED

                          WAYNE
           Just trying to find out more about
           our jewel thief. I ran her prints
           from the photos she handled -
          Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
          suspect.
           - but she was wearing someone
           else's fingerprints. She's good.

                          ALFRED
           She may be. But we have the trace
           on the necklace.

                         

                          WAYNE
           We do, so I cross-referenced the

           Selina Kyle. The databases are full
           of close calls, tips from fences...

           My fingerprints. There was printer
           toner mixed with graphite on the

           Hoping for things to go bad again.

                         
          Wayne says nothing.
           Remember when you left Gotham?
           Before all this. Before Batman.
           Seven years you were gone. Seven
           years I waited. Hoping that you
           wouldn't come back.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
           Every year I took my holiday. I'd
           go to Florence. There's a café by
           the Arno... Any fine evening I
           would sit there and order a Fernet
           Branca...
          INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
           I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
           that one day I'd look across the
           tables, and see you. Sitting there
           with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
           You wouldn't say anything to me, or
           me to you, but we'd both
           know...that you'd made it. That you
           were happy.

                         
          INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
          closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
           I never wanted you to come back to
           Gotham. I knew there was nothing
           there for you but pain and tragedy,
           and I wanted more for you than
           that. I still do.
          Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.

                         

                         

          EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY

          Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
          DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.

                         

                          DWP MAN
           They wash up a couple times a
           month. More when in gets colder -
           homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
           We had to pull him to clear the
           basin, but other than that we
           didn't touch him...

           21.

                         

                         
          They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
          a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.

                          ROSS
           What?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Name's Jimmy. He's at St.
           Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys
           home where I...I coach some ball.

                         

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY

          Blake looks up at the shabby building.

                         

                         

          INT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER

          Blake is talking to Father Reilly.

                          FATHER REILLY
           Jimmy hadn't been here for months.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          FATHER REILLY
           You know why, Blake - he aged out.
           We don't have the resources to keep
           boys on after sixteen -

                          BLAKE
           The Wayne Foundation gives money
           for that -

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Not for two years now.

                          BLAKE
           He has a brother here, right?

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Mark. I'll tell him.

                          BLAKE
           I'd like to, if that's okay.

           22.

                         

                         

          EXT. PLAYGROUND, ST. SWITHIN'S - MOMENTS LATER

          Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten.

                          BLAKE
           I'm sorry.

                         
          Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.

                          BLAKE
           What was he doing in the tunnels?

                         

                          MARK
           Lot of guys been going down the
           tunnels when they age out. Say you
           can live down there. Say there's
           work down there.

                         

                          BLAKE
           What kind of work are you gonna
           find in the sewers?

                          MARK
           More than you can find up here, I
           guess.
          Blake considers this. Troubled.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

          Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
          in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
          over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.

                         

                          STRYVER
           You brought a date?

                          SELINA
           I like having someone around to
           open doors for me.

                         
          Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
          Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.

                          SELINA
           Right hand. No partials.
          Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
          up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.

           23.

                         

                         

                          STRYVER
           Very nice.
          He pockets the envelope.

                          SELINA
           Not so fast, handsome. You got
           something for me?

                          STRYVER
           Oh, yes.

                         
          Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
          joins them at the table. Selina smiles.

                          SELINA
           I don't know what you're going to
           do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
           I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
          As Stryver checks the envelope again -

                          SELINA
           You don't count so good, huh?

                          STRYVER
           I count fine.
          The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.

                         

                          STRYVER
           In fact, I'm counting to ten right
           now...
          Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
          blinks.

                          SELINA
           Okay, okay -

                         
          She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
          himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.

                          SELINA
           My friend is waiting outside. Just
           hit 'send'...

                         
          Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
          options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
          door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
          Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.

           24.

                         

                         

                          JEN
           Place is a little dead.

                          SELINA
           (takes envelope, tense)
           It'll liven up in a minute, trust
           me.

                          JEN
           Everything okay?

                         

                          SELINA
           Great. Catch you later.
          Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.

                          SELINA
           It would've been a lot easier to
           just give me what we agreed.

                          STRYVER
           We can't have loose ends. And even
           in that dress, no one's going to
           miss you.

                          SELINA
           No. But my friend over there...?
          Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
          nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...

                          SELINA
           Every cop in the city's missing
           him.

                         
          Across the bar, the TV on mute -

          MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
          Stryver looks at Selina.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Cute. But they're not gonna be
           looking in a place like this.

                          SELINA
           I don't know... You did just use
           his cell phone.
          Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
          Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
          descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
          SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs

           25.

                         

                         
          Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
          other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
          Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.

                          SWAT
           It's alright, Miss. Just stay down

                          -
          The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
          through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
          weapons.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
          bar, clutching his bleeding leg.

                         

                          SELINA
           Keep some pressure on that,
           sweetheart.
          She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar.
          Moves for the door.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN

                          (WEAK)
           Call me?

                         

                         

          EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina waltzes out - right into Blake. She feigns panic.

                          SELINA
           There's a man in there - he's
           bleeding!

                          BLAKE
           It's okay, Miss. It's okay.

                         
          Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
          He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
          truck and into the night.

           26.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman.

                          BLAKE

                          (INTO RADIO)
           I've got the Congressman - bullet
           to the leg, but he's okay.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
          race around a corner into a smaller passage.
          A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
          jumps out, gun drawn.

                         
          The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
          tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
          counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
          The passage is empty.

                         
          The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -

                          GORDON
           Manhole!

                         
          He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
          Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.

                          GORDON
           You three, down with me. You two,
           head down to cover the next exit -

                         

                          SWAT
           Where -?

                          GORDON
           Get the DWP down here, now!

                         
          Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs
          fall in behind...

           27.

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole.

                          COP
           Where's the DWP guy?

                         

                          BLAKE
           They went down there?

                          FOLEY
           (shaking his head)
           And Gordon took SWAT in after them.

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
          corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
          the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
          ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
          tearing through the tunnels.

          Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole.

                         

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him
          turn - WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug.

          Blake pushes forward.

                          BLAKE
           Come on, we gotta get down there -

                         

                          COP
           That was a gas explosion, kid -

           Gas? This is a sewer!

                          FOLEY
           No one goes in there till we know

                          FOLEY
           Somebody get the hothead out of
           here. And get me a DWP guy!
          Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.

          Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.

                          THUG 1
           This one's alive. (Looks closer.)
           Jesus. It's the Police
           Commissioner.

                          THUG 2
           What do we do?

                         

                          THUG 1
           Take him to Bane.
          The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
          As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
          men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
          and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
          Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
          stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
          between two waterfalls, into -

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

          They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
          firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
          line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...

                         

                          BANE
           Why are you here?
          The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.

                         

                          THUG 1
           Answer him!
          Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.

           29.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           I'm asking you.

                          THUG 1
           It's the Police Commissioner.

                         

                          BANE
           And you brought him down here?

                          THUG 2
           We didn't know what to do. We -

                         

                          BANE
           You panicked. And your weakness
           costs three lives.

                          THUG 1
           No, he's alone -
          Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
          Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.

                          BANE
           Search him. Then I will kill you.
          The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
          gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
          Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
          the papers. Unfolds them...

                         
          As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
          rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...

                          THUG 2
           He's dead.

                         
          Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...

                          BANE
           Then show me his body.

                         

                          THUG 2
           That water runs to any one of the
           outflows - we'd never find him.
          Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.

                         

                          BANE
           Give me your GPS.
          Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
          jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.

           30.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Follow him.

                          THUG 2
           Follow him?

                         
          Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
          Mercenary.

                          BANE
           Track him. Make sure both bodies
           will not be found. Then brick up
           the south tunnel.

          Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something
          stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the
          raging waters - Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls
          him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying...

                         

                         

          INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform.

                          BLAKE
           I need to see Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
           unscheduled calls. Even from police
           officers.

                         

                          BLAKE
           And if I go get a warrant, in the
           investigation of Harvey Dent's
           murder? Would that still count as
           unscheduled?

                         

                         

          INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.

                         

                          WAYNE
           What can I do for you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

           31.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm sorry to hear that -

                          BLAKE
           He chased a gunman down into the
           sewers. When I pulled him out he
           was babbling about an underground
           army. A masked man called 'Bane'.

                          WAYNE
           Shouldn't you be telling this to
           your superior officers?

                          BLAKE
           I did. One of them asked if he saw
           any giant alligators down there. He
           needs you. He needs the Batman.

                         

                          WAYNE
           If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
           the Batman he must be in a bad way

                          -

                         

                          BLAKE
           He doesn't know or care who you
           are. (Off look.) But we've met
           before. When I was a kid. At the
           orphanage. See, my mom died when I
           was small. Car accident, I don't
           really remember it. But a couple of
           years later my dad was shot over a
           gambling debt. I remember that just
           fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
           of people who know what it feels
           like, do they? To be angry. In your
           bones. People understand, foster
           parents understand. For a while.
           Then they expect the angry kid to
           do what he knows he can never do.
           To move on. To forget.

                         
          Wayne stares at Blake.

                          BLAKE
           So they stopped understanding and
           sent the angry kid to a boys' home
           - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
           by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
           figured it out too late. You have
           to hide the anger. Practice smiling
           in the mirror. Like putting on a
           mask. You showed up one day in a
           cool car, pretty girl on your arm.

           We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
           billionaire orphan. We made up
           stories about you. Legends. The
           other boys' stories were just that.
           But when I saw you I knew who you
           really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
           that look on your face. Same one I
           taught myself.
          Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.

                         

                          BLAKE
           I don't know why you took the fall
           for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
           believer in the Batman. Even if
           you're not.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Why did you say your boys' home
           used to be funded by the Wayne
           Foundation?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Because the money stopped. Might be
           time to get some fresh air and
           start paying attention to the
           details. Some of those details
           might need your help.

           Ran it through some databases. He's
           a mercenary. No other known name.
           Never been seen or photographed
           without a mask. He and his men were
           behind a coup in West Africa that
           secured mining operations for our
           friend John Daggett.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Now Daggett's brought them here?

           It would seem so. I'll keep
           digging.

                          WAYNE
           Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.

                          ALFRED
           I'll get him on the phone -

           No. Do we still have any cars

           One or two.

           And I need an appointment at the

           Which hospital, sir?

           Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

           I see you haven't lost your sense
           of humor...even if you have lost
           most of my money.

                          FOX
           Actually, you did that yourself.
           See, if you funnel the entire R and
           D budget for five years into a
           fusion project that you then
           mothball, your company is unlikely
           to thrive.

           35.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Even with -

                         

                          FOX
           A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
           Wayne Enterprises is running out of
           time. And Daggett is moving in.

                          WAYNE
           What're my options?

                          FOX
           If you're not willing to turn your
           machine on -

                         

                          WAYNE
           I can't, Lucius.

                          FOX
           Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
           Daggett at arm's length while we
           figure out a future for the energy
           program with Miranda Tate - she's
           supported your project all the way.
           She's smart, and quite lovely.

                          WAYNE
           You too, Lucius?

                          FOX
           We all just want what's best for
           you, Bruce. Show her the machine.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'll think it over.

                          FOX
           Anything else?

                         

                          WAYNE
           No, why?

                          FOX
           These conversations always used to
           end with some...unusual requests.

                          WAYNE
           I retired.

                          FOX
           Let me show you some stuff, anyway.
          Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden
          elevator.

           36.

                         

                         

          INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER

          Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They
          pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...

                          WAYNE
           I figured you'd have shut this
           place down.

                          FOX
           It was always shut down,
           officially.

                          WAYNE
           But all this new stuff?

                          FOX
           After your father died, Wayne
           Enterprises set up fourteen
           different defense subsidiaries.
           I've spent years shuttering them
           and consolidating all the
           prototypes under one roof. My roof.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Why?

                          FOX
           Stop them falling into the wrong
           hands. Besides, I thought someone
           might get some use out of them...
          Wayne shakes his head.

                          FOX
           Sure I can't tempt you to
           something? Pneumatic crampons?
           Infrared lenses? Least let me get
           you something for that leg.

                         

                          WAYNE
           It's fine the use it gets these
           days.

                          FOX
           Well, then I have just the thing
           for an eccentric billionaire who
           doesn't like to walk...
          Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes
          light up.

           37.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Now you're just showing off.

                         

                          FOX
           Defense Department project for
           tight-geometry urban pacification.
           Rotors configured for maneuvering
           between buildings without
           recirculation.

                         

                          WAYNE
           What's it called?

                          FOX
           It has a long and uninteresting
           Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
           took to calling it the Bat. And
           yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
           black.
          Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.

                         

                          FOX
           Works great except for the
           autopilot.

                          WAYNE
           What's wrong with that?

                          FOX
           Software-based instability. Take a
           better mind than mine to fix it.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Better mind?

                          FOX
           I was trying to be modest. A less
           busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
          Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.

                          WAYNE
           I told you. I retired, Lucius.

                         

                         

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.

                         

                          DOCTOR
           I've seen worse cartilage in knees

                          -

           38.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           That's good -

                          DOCTOR
           No, that's because there is no
           cartilage in your knee. And not
           much of any use in your elbows and
           shoulders. Between that and the
           scar tissue on your kidneys,
           residual concussive damage to your
           brain tissue and general
           scarred-over quality of your
           body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
           cannot recommend that you go
           heli-skiing. About the only part of
           your body that looks healthy is
           your liver, so if you're bored I
           recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
           Wayne.
          Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
          steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
          which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
          frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

                         

          EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne drops three floors...

                         

                         

          INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
          mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
          to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...

                          GORDON
           We were in this together. Then you
           were gone...

                         

                          WAYNE
           The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
           We won.

                          GORDON
           Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
           there's evil rising from where we
           tried to bury it. Nobody will
           listen... The Batman has to come
           back.

           39.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           What if he doesn't exist anymore?

                          GORDON
           He must. He must.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

          Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
          houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
          dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
          picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you - money first -

           YUPPIE (O.S.)
           Goddammit, you took my wallet!

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
          her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
          grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.

                          SELINA
           Get out.

                         

                          YUPPIE
           She took my wallet!
          Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.

                          SELINA
           Now.
          She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
          Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.

                          SELINA
           I told you not to try it with the
           assholes, Jen.

                          JEN
           They're all assholes.

           40.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Okay, the assholes who hit.

                          JEN
           I don't know what he's so upset
           about, he only had sixty bucks in
           here.

                          SELINA
           Probably the watch.

                         

                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Watch?
          Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

          Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
          pulls out. Checking his tracker.

                         

                         

          EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER

          Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
          Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.
          Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...

                         

                          PAPARAZZI
           Another stiff too old to climb out
           of his sports car.

                          PAPARAZZI 2
           No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
           where you been hiding?
          Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
          - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not sure if my assistant put me
           on the guest list -

                          GREETER
           Right through here, Mr. Wayne...

           41.

                         

                         

          INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

          A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
          confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
          He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
          wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
          Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
          only concession to fancy dress.

                          WAYNE
           Miss Tate, isn't it?

                          MIRANDA
           Even before you became a recluse,
           you never came to these things...

                          WAYNE
           True. Proceeds go to the big fat
           spread, not the cause. It's not
           about charity, it's about feeding
           the ego of whichever society hag
           laid it on.

                          MIRANDA
           Actually, this is my party, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           Oh.

                          MIRANDA
           And the proceeds will go where they
           should, because I paid for the big
           fat spread myself.

                          WAYNE
           That's very generous of you.

                          MIRANDA
           You have to invest to restore
           balance to the world. Take our
           clean-energy project...

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sometimes the investment doesn't
           pay off. Sorry.

           42.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
           Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
           about the world doesn't spend half
           his fortune on a plan to save it...
           (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
           it fails that he goes into
           hiding...
          Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
          Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.

                          WAYNE
           Mind if I cut in?
          Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
          Selina by the waist. She glares at him.

                          WAYNE
           You don't seem very happy to see
           me.

                          SELINA
           You were supposed to be a shut-in.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Felt like some fresh air.

                          SELINA
           Why didn't you call the police?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I have a powerful friend who deals
           with this kind of thing. (Admires
           her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
           cat burglar.

                         

                          SELINA
           Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

                          WAYNE
           Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
           Who's your date?

                          SELINA
           His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
           diamonds behind, though. Worried
           they'd get stolen.

           43.

                         

                          WAYNE
          It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
          wouldn't want these folks realizing
          you're a crook not a social
          climber.

                         

                          SELINA
           (flash of anger)
          You think I care what anyone in
          this room thinks about me?

                         

                          WAYNE
          I doubt you care what anyone in
          this room thinks about you.

                          SELINA
          Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
          don't know a thing about me.

                          WAYNE
          Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
          here from your walk-up in Old Town
          - modest place for a master jewel
          thief. Which means either you're
          saving for your retirement - or
          you're in deep with the wrong
          people.

                         

                          SELINA
          You don't get to judge me because
          you were born in the master bedroom
          of Wayne Manor.

                          WAYNE
          Actually, I was born in the Regency
          Room.

                          SELINA
          I started off doing what I had to.
          Once you've done what you had to
          they'll never let you do what you
          want to.

                          WAYNE
          Start fresh.

                         

                          SELINA
          There's no fresh start in today's
          world. Any twelve-year-old with a
          cell phone could find out what you
          did. Everything we do is collated
          and quantified. Everything sticks.
          We are the sum of our mistakes.

           44.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Or our achievements.

                          SELINA
           The mistakes stick better. Trust
           me.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You think that justifies stealing?

                          SELINA
           I take what I need to from those
           who have more than enough. I don't
           stand on the shoulders of people
           with less.

                          WAYNE
           Robin Hood?

                          SELINA
           I'd do more to help someone than
           most of the people in this room.
           Than you.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you're assuming too much.

                          SELINA
           Or maybe you're being unrealistic
           about what's really in your pants
           other than your wallet.

                          WAYNE
           Ouch.

                         

                          SELINA
           You think all this can last?
          Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.

                         

                          SELINA
           There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
           You and your friends better batten
           down the hatches, because when it
           hits you're all gonna wonder how
           you ever thought you could live so
           large and leave so little to the
           rest of us.

                          WAYNE
           Sounds like you're looking forward
           to it.

           45.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           I'm adaptable.

                          WAYNE
           These pearls do look better on you
           then they did in my safe...

                         
          Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
          of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
           But I still can't let you keep
           them.

                         
          The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
          looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
          into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.

                          RICH TWIT

                          (ANNOYED)
           You scared her off.

                          WAYNE
           Not likely.

                         

                         

          EXT. MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets.

                          WAYNE
           I must have lost my ticket -

                          VALET
           Your wife said you were taking a
           cab home, sir.

                         

                          WAYNE
           My wife?

                         

          INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI RACING DOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the
          engine.

                         

          INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER


                         
          Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back.

                          ALFRED
           Just you, sir?

                         
          Wayne gives him a withering glare.

                          (MORE)

           46.

                         

                          ALFRED (CONT'D)
           Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
           little time to get back into the
           swing of things.
          Wayne dials his phone.

           FOX (O.S.)
           This is Fox.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Remember those 'unusual requests' I
           used to make?

           FOX (O.S.)
           I knew it!
          Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - DAY


                         
          Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
          strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
          moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
          Thermos.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You've got the wrong leg, sir.

                          WAYNE
           You start with the good limb so it
           learns your optimum muscle
           patterns.
          Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
          - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
           Now we tighten it up.

                         
          Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
          tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.

                          ALFRED
           It is terribly painful?

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (GRITTED TEETH)
           You're welcome to try it, Alfred.

                          ALFRED
           Happy watching, thank you, sir.
          Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.

           47.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Not bad -
          Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
           Not bad at all.

                         
          Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
          Wayne across the bridge to the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne, if you're considering
           going back out there you need to
           hear some rumors surrounding Bane.

                          WAYNE
           I'm all ears.

                         

                          ALFRED
           There is a prison. In a more
           ancient part of the world. A pit.
           Where men are thrown to suffer and
           die. But sometimes, a man rises
           from the darkness. Sometimes...the
           pit sends something back.

                          WAYNE
           Bane.

                          ALFRED
           Born and raised in a hell on earth.

           Born in a prison?

           No one knows why. Or how he
           escaped. But they know who trained
           him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your

                          A U
           mentor.

                         
          Wayne takes this in. Shocked.

                          ALFRED
           He plucked Bane from a dark corner
           of the earth and trained him in the
           blackest disciplines of combat,
           deception and endurance. Just like
           you.

                          WAYNE
           Bane was a member of the League of

           That was then. And you can strap up
           your leg and put the mask back on.
           But it won't make you what you

           Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
           Your resources, your
           knowledge...not your body. Not your

                          WAYNE
           I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
           Alfred. And I failed.

                          ALFRED
           You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
           Batman, you can't afford to.

                          WAYNE
           That's what you're afraid of - that
           if I go back out there I'll fail.

                         

                          ALFRED
           No. I'm afraid that you want to.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.

          INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

          A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...
          Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.

                         

                          TRADER 2
           You can't short the stock because
           Bruce Wayne goes to a party -

                          TRADER 1
           Wayne coming back is change. Change
           is either good or bad.

                          TRADER 2
           On what basis?

                         

                          TRADER 1
           I flipped a coin.
          Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
          there negotiating with a Trader.

                         

                          TRADER 3
           No. Rye. I told 'em rye.
          Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
           Alright, I'll take it.

                         
          He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
          At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
          wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
          face.

                         

           FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
           Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
           a camera.) We need faces for
           cameras.

                         
          In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
          the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
          At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
          man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
          the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
          gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide

          floor.

          In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
          pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.

                         
          Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
          - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
          moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
          Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
          Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
          lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
          Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
          floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
          screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...

                         

                          TRADER 1

                          BANE
           Why else would you people be here?
          Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
          floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
          man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.

          Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.
          Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs
          it into the computer - figures race across the screen...

          Daggett watches, intrigued.

          Foley shouts down the phone.

                          FOLEY
           How did you let him go?!

                          COP

                          (OVER RADIO)
           He's got a lot of firepower -

                         

                          FOLEY
           And you don't?! We're not letting
           one nut with a bad attitude and
           some fancy gadgets run this town
           down, you hear me?!

                         

                          COP

                          (OVER RADIO)
           He's heading back downtown...

                          FOLEY

                          (EXCITED)
           Then he's as dumb as he dresses -
           close it down, gentlemen!

           58.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Thousands of police jockey to pursue the Batman as he races
          back into the downtown area.

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          The Bat-Pod tears along, pursued by a phalanx of cruisers,
          choppers overhead. More cops appear at the far end of the
          boulevard.

                         
          The Bat-Pod executes a ninety-degree turn, flipping over as
          it goes, then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley.
          Cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley. Blake
          arrives last, his cruiser sealing the bottleneck. Foley
          swaggers out.

                          FOLEY
           Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen...
          Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from
          the alley that none of the cops have heard before...

                          VETERAN COP
           You might have the wrong animal
           there, sir -

                         
          Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of
          the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor
          downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground.
          The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham
          PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Are you sure that was him?
          Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.

          Gordon, still hooked up to machines, watches TV. He smiles.

                         

                          ANNOUNCER

                          (ON TV)
           Police are keeping quiet about the
           prospect of a return by the Batman,
           but eyewitness accounts seem the
           clearly suggests the type of...

          INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

          Daggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters.

                          STRYVER
           Bane says the Batman interfered,
           but the task was accomplished.

                          DAGGETT
           What about the men they arrested?

                         

                          STRYVER
           He says, and I quote, they would
           die before talking.

                          DAGGETT

                          (GRINS)
           Where does he find these guys?
          Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner
          office.
           Open the champagne...

                         

                         

          INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Daggett comes through the door, calling back.

                          DAGGETT
           And can we get some girls in here?

           CATWOMAN (O.S.)
           Careful what you wish for.
          Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back
          slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! -
          Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using
          the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.

                          CATWOMAN
           Cat got your tongue?
          She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.

                          DAGGETT
           You dumb bitch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Nobody ever accused me of being
           dumb.

           60.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Dumb to show up here tonight.

                          CATWOMAN
           I want what you owe me -

                         
          Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.

                          DAGGETT
           'I want' never gets...

                         
          Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her
          leg...

                          STRYVER
           Nice outfit...those heels make it
           tough to walk?

                         
          Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know, do they?

                         
          Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.

                          CATWOMAN
           So where is it?

                          DAGGETT
           Where's what?

                          CATWOMAN
           The program. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          DAGGETT
           Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
           master thief with a record. I don't
           have it.
          The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
          Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her
          heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the
          window. He screams - they drop...

                         

          EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          ...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses
          her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down
          the side of the building.

           61.

                         

                         

          EXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

          Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Where is it?

                         

                          DAGGETT
           The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name
           and date of birth and within a
           couple hours that person ceases to
           exist in any database? Little too
           good to be true.

                          CATWOMAN
           You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
           prototype stage -

                         

                          DAGGETT
           That's why I bought them. But they
           had nothing. It was a gangland
           myth.

                         
          Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
          drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not
          Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
          Daggett by the throat, threatening him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Stay back!
          They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
          onto his gun.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'm not bluffing!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           They know...

                         
          All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
          it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.

                          BATMAN
           They just don't care.

                         
          As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
          forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
          fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
          fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
          another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
          miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.

           62.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           You've got to be kidding.

                          BATMAN
           No guns. No killing.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Where's the fun in that?
          As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
          the far edge.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Come on!
          Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
          She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
          sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
          Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
          gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
          cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
          hisses shut, taking bullets from above.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           My mother warned me about getting
           into cars with strange men -

                          BATMAN
           This isn't a car.
          Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
          downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
          but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
          the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

                         

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           See you around -
          Batman steps down after her.

                         

                          BATMAN
           You're welcome.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had it under control.

           63.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Those weren't street thugs - they
           were trained killers. I saved your
           life. In return I need to know what
           you did with Bruce Wayne's
           fingerprints.
          Catwoman looks at him. Considering.

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne wasn't kidding about a
           'powerful friend'. I sold his
           prints to Daggett. For something
           that doesn't even exist.

                          BATMAN
           I doubt many people get the better
           of you.

                          CATWOMAN
           Hey, when a girl's desperate...

                         

                          BATMAN
           What were they going to do with
           them?

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know. But Daggett seemed
           pretty interested in that mess at
           the stock market.
          Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
          searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Miss Kyle -?
          But she is gone.
           So that's what that feels like.

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

          Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
          at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
          brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
          water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
          Alfred brushes water off his suit.

                          ALFRED
           Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell
           the neighbors you got yourself a
           new leaf-blower?

           64.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           We bought all the neighbors.
          Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.

                          ALFRED
           From the look of the television
           coverage, you seem to have your
           taste for wanton destruction back.

                          WAYNE
           (pulls out USB drive)
           I retrieved this.

                          ALFRED
           Shouldn't the police be gathering
           the evidence?

                         

                          WAYNE
           They don't have the tools to
           analyze it.

                          ALFRED
           They would if you gave them to them

                          -

                          WAYNE
           One man's tool is another man's
           weapon.

                         

                          ALFRED
           In your mind, perhaps. But there
           aren't many things you couldn't
           turn into a weapon.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred. Enough. The police weren't
           getting it done -

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps they would've if you
           haven't made a sideshow of
           yourself.

                          WAYNE
           Perhaps you're upset you were
           wrong.

                          ALFRED
           Wrong?

           65.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           You thought I didn't have it in me.
          Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.

                          ALFRED
           You don't. You lead a bloated
           police force on a merry chase with
           some fancy new toys from Fox. What
           about when you come up against him.
           What then?

                         
          Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...

                          WAYNE
           I'll fight harder, I always have.

                         

                          ALFRED
           When you had something to fight
           for. What are you fighting for now?
           Not your life.
          Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
          hand.

                          ALFRED
           Take a good look. At his speed, his
           ferocity, His training. I see the
           power of belief. Of the fanatic. I
           see the League of Shadows
           resurgent.

                          WAYNE
           You said he was excommunicated.

                         

                          ALFRED
           By R¯'s al Gh¯l. Who leads them

                          A U
           now?

                          WAYNE
           R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of

                          A U
           Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's
           just a mercenary, and we have to
           find out what he's up to.
          Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Trades of some kind. Coded...
          The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.

           66.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Is that -?

           Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.

                         
          Wayne pulls out the USB, rises.
           Get this to Fox - he can crack the
           code and tell us what trades they
           were executing.

                         
          Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

          As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'll get this to Fox. But no more.
          Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've sewn you up and set your
           bones...but I won't bury you. I've
           buried enough members of the Wayne
           family.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You'd abandon me?

                          ALFRED
           You see only one end to your story.
           Leaving is all I have to make you
           understand: you aren't Batman
           anymore - you have to find another
           way. You used to talk about
           finishing. About life beyond that
           awful cave -

                         

                          WAYNE
           Rachel died knowing we'd decided to
           be together. That was my life
           beyond this cave and I can't just
           move on. She didn't. She couldn't.

                         
          Alfred considers this. Looks away.

                          ALFRED
           What if he had? What if she wasn't
           intending to make a life with you?

           67.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           She was, I can't change that -

                          ALFRED
           What if, before she died, she'd
           written a letter? Explaining that
           she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
          Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -

                          ALFRED
           And what if, to spare you
           pain...I'd burned that letter?
          Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.

                          WAYNE
           Why would you say such a thing?

                          ALFRED
           Because I have to make you
           understand.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You're lying.

                          ALFRED
           Because you are as precious to me
           as you were to your own mother and
           father and I swore to them that I
           would protect you and I haven't.

                          WAYNE
           You're lying!

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've never lied to you. Except when
           I burned Rachel's letter.
          Wayne turns on the old man, furious.

                         

                          WAYNE
           How dare you use Rachel to stop me!

                          ALFRED
           I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.
           Maybe it's time we all stopped
           trying to outsmart the truth and
           just let it have its day. I'm
           sorry.

           68.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
           world, then shake hands?!

                          ALFRED
           No. I know what this means -

                          WAYNE
           What does it mean, Alfred?!

                          ALFRED
           It means your hatred. It means
           losing the person I've cared for
           ever since I heard his first cries
           echo through this house. But it
           might also mean saving your life.
           And that is more important.

                         
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to
          say and says it quietly and calmly.

                          WAYNE
           Goodbye, Alfred.

                         

                          ALFRED

                          (QUIET)
           Goodbye, Bruce.
          Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.

                         

                         

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Wayne is woken by the doorbell.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing
          gown, he can't resist one tentative.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred?
          But Alfred is gone.

                         

                         

          INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised.

           69.

                         

                         

                          FOX
           Answering your own door?

                          WAYNE
           Yes. Could you decode the trades on
           that drive?

                         
          Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:

          BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...

                         

                          FOX
           I didn't need to. Page three.
          Wayne turns the page:

          WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...

                         

                          FOX
           It seems you made a series of large

           exchange. Verified by thumb print.
           The options expired at midnight
           last night.
          Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.

                          FOX
           Long term we may be able to prove
           fraud, but for now...you're
           completely broke. And Wayne
           Enterprises is about to fall into
           the hands of John Daggett.

                          WAYNE
           The weapons - we can't let Daggett
           get his hands on Applied Sciences -

                          FOX
           Applied Sciences is shut up tight,
           and off the books. The energy
           project is a different story.

                          WAYNE
           Miranda Tate. We need to convince
           the board to get behind her. Let's
           show her the reactor -

                          FOX
           We're meeting her there in
           thirty-five minutes. You better get
           dressed.

          EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY

          A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the
          towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.

                          MIRANDA
           You brought me out here to show me
           a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?

                         

                          FOX
           Bear with me, Miss Tate.
          They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.

                         

                         

          INT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS

          Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her.

                          FOX
           Keep your hands and feet inside the
           car at all times.
          He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
          as the office becomes an elevator into -

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

          They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...

                          MIRANDA
           This is it, isn't it?

                         

                          FOX
           The reactor is beneath the river so
           that it could be instantly flooded
           in an event of a security breach.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Is Bruce Wayne really that
           paranoid?

                          FOX
           I'm gonna plead the fifth on that
           one.
          Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
          figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I thought you might like to see
           what your investment built.

           71.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           No radiation, no fossil fuels.
           Free, clean energy for an entire
           city.

                          WAYNE
           If it worked. It doesn't.
          Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
          electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
          Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.

                          WAYNE
           Ignition, yes. But no chain
           reaction.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You've built a lot of security
           around a damp squib.
          Nothing.
           About three years ago a Russian
           scientist published a paper on
           weaponized fusion reactions. One
           week later your reactor started
           developing problems... (Looks at
           Wayne.) I think this machine works.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Miranda, if it were operational,
           the danger to Gotham would be too
           great.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Would it make you feel better to
           know that the Russian scientist
           died in a plane crash six months
           ago?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Someone else will work out what Dr.
           Pavel did. Someone else will figure
           out how to turn this power source
           into a nuclear weapon. I need you
           to take control of Wayne
           Enterprises and this reactor.

                          MIRANDA
           And to do what with it?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Nothing. Until we can find a way to
           guarantee its safety.

           72.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And if we can't?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Decommission it. Flood it.

                          MIRANDA
           Destroy the world's best chance for
           a sustainable future?

                         

                          WAYNE
           If the world's not ready. Yes.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce, if you want to save the
           world you have to start trusting
           it.

                          WAYNE
           I'm trusting you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Doesn't count. You have no choice.

                          WAYNE
           I could've flooded this chamber any
           time in the last three years. I'm
           choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
           that's not the easiest thing for
           me. Please.
          His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.

                         

                          FOX
           We have a board meeting to get to.

                         

          INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY


                         
          The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
          seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.

                          DAGGETT
           I'd like to point out that we have
           a non-board member here. Highly
           irregular, even if it is his family
           name above the door...
          All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.

                         

                          FREDERICKS
           Bruce Wayne's family built this

                          COMPANY -

           73.

                         

                         

                          BOARD MEMBER 2
           And he himself has run it -

                          DAGGETT
           Into the ground, sir. Anybody
           disagree? Check the value of your
           shares this morning. Gambling on
           crazy futures didn't just lose Mr.
           Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a
           lot of money. He needs to leave.

                         

                          FOX
           I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.

                         
          Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.

                          DAGGETT
           Let's get down to business.

                         

                          FOX
           Right away.

                         

          INT. LOBBY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of
          Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters.

                          REPORTER
           Wayne, how's it feel to be one of
           the people?!

                         

                          COMPANY VALET
           I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork

                          -

                         
          Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.

           BLAKE (O.S.)
           Looks like you need a lift.
          Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.

           74.

                         

                         

          INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

          Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.

                          DAGGETT
           How the hell did Miranda Tate get
           the inside track on the Wayne
           board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
           Was she sleeping with Wayne?

                          STRYVER
           Not that we know of -

                          DAGGETT
           Clearly you don't 'know of'
           anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!

                         

                          STRYVER
           We told him it was urgent -

                          DAGGETT
           Then where is the masked -

                         

           BANE (O.S.)
           Speak of the devil...
          Daggett turns. Bane is already there.

                          BANE
           ...and he shall appear.

                          DAGGETT
           What the hell's going on?

                          BANE
           The plan is proceeding as expected.

                          DAGGETT
           You see me running Wayne
           Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
           Your stock exchange hit didn't
           work, friend. And now you've got my
           construction crews working all
           hours around the city? How's that
           supposed to help my company absorb
           Wayne's?

                         

                          BANE

                          (TO STRYVER)
           Leave us.

           75.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           You stay right there! I'm in
           charge!
          Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.

                         

                          BANE
           Do you feel in charge?
          Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.

                         

                          DAGGETT
           I've paid you a small fortune -

                          BANE
           And that gives you power over me?

                         
          Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.

                          DAGGETT
           What is this?

                          BANE
           Your money and infrastructure have
           been important. Till now.

                          DAGGETT
           What are you?

                         

                          BANE
           Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
           borrowed time you've all been
           living on...

                         
          Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
          hands...

                          DAGGETT
           You are true evil...

                         

                          BANE
           I am necessary evil.
          Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.

                         

                         

                         SCENE OMITTED

           76.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.

                          BLAKE
           When you began...why the mask?

                         

                          WAYNE
           To protect the people closest to
           me.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You're a loner with no family.

                          WAYNE
           There are always people you care
           about. You just don't realize how
           much until they're gone. (Collects
           himself.) The idea was to be a
           symbol. Batman could be anybody,
           that was the point.

                          BLAKE
           It was damn good to see him back.

                          WAYNE
           Not everybody agrees.

                          BLAKE
           They'll figure it out in the end.

                          WAYNE
           Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

                          BLAKE
           Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
           of tunnel records and a flashlight.
           I could use some help.

                          WAYNE

                          (THINKS)
           You know what? Drop me in Old
           Town...

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY


                         
          Blake drops Wayne off.

                          WAYNE
           Don't wait. I'll get a cab.

           77.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You got money?

                         

                          WAYNE
           (smiles, sheepish)
           Actually, no.
          Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
          The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

                         

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.

                         

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you, money first.

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           I don't think so.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.

                          SELINA
           He's not a mark.
          Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.

                          SELINA
           And he doesn't have a cent to his
           name, anyway.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
          embarrassed.

                          SELINA
           Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
           it's more that you've got right
           now.

                          WAYNE
           Actually, they're letting me keep
           the house.

                         

                          SELINA

                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           The rich don't even go broke same
           as the rest of us, huh?

           78.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           (spots her bag)
           Vacation?

                          SELINA
           Let's just say that I've incurred
           the wrath of some people less
           susceptible to my charms than you.

                          WAYNE
           My powerful friend hopes to change
           your mind about leaving.

                          SELINA
           And how would he do that?

                          WAYNE
           By giving you what you want.

                          SELINA
           It doesn't exist.

                          WAYNE
           He says it does. He wants to meet.
           Tonight.

                          SELINA
           Why?

                         

                          WAYNE
           He needs to find Bane. He thinks
           you'd know how.

                          SELINA
           Tell him I'll think about it.
          Wayne nods, starts to leave.

                          SELINA
           Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all
           your money.

                          WAYNE
           No, you're not.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for -

           79.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.

                          FOLEY
           Can we help you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           John Daggett's body was found in a
           dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
           might like to know.

                         

                          GORDON
           Why?

                          BLAKE
           Because Daggett's name is all over
           the permits I pulled to map the
           tunnels under Gotham.
          Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.

                         

                          BLAKE
           MTA maintenance, sewer
           construction...

                          GORDON

                          (TO FOLEY)
           Where did you get to with the
           tunnel searches?

                          FOLEY

                          (TO BLAKE)
           Remind me to tell the detail to
           keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
           We've had teams down there, but
           it's a huge network -

                          GORDON
           Get more men, work a grid. I want
           him found.

                          FOLEY
           Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
           on it.

                         
          Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.

                          GORDON
           This is good work. Lose the uniform
           - you're working for me now. We
           could use some hotter heads around
           here.

           80.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           This could just be a coincidence.

                          GORDON
           You're a detective now, son, you're
           not allowed to believe in
           coincidence anymore.
          Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)

          Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
          driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Nobody's answering.
          Wayne turns to find Miranda there.

                          WAYNE
           No. I'm on my own now.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Do you have keys?
          Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Never needed them...
          She takes his hand.

                          MIRANDA
           Let's find a window.

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)

          They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
          rain.

                          MIRANDA
           Fox worked the board like you've
           never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
           and he's not happy.
          Wayne sets down the newspaper:

          FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM

           81.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Hope you don't like me for your
           money.
          Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Suffering builds character.
          Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           I'll take care of your parents'
           legacy, Bruce.
          Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Who's this?
          Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...

                          MIRANDA
           Where's Alfred?

                          WAYNE
           He left. Taking everything.
          Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
          again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.

                          MIRANDA
           What's that?

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SHEEPISH)
           I think my power's been shut off.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER (NIGHT)


                         
          Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.

                          WAYNE
           You're pretty good at that.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           When I was a child we had almost
           nothing. But on the nights we had a
           fire, we felt very rich indeed.
          She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.

           82.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I assumed your family was wealthy.

                          MIRANDA
           Not always. Not when I was young.

                         
          He traces a scar on her shoulder.

                          MIRANDA
           An old mistake.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I've made a few myself.
          She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.

                          MIRANDA
           More than a few... (Smiles.) We
           could leave. Tonight. Take my
           plane. Go anywhere we wanted.

                          WAYNE
           Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
          She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
          other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.

                         

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

          Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
          her for a moment, then slips out...

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.

                         

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT


                         
          The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and
          main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons.

                         

          INT. MIA TUNNEL - LATER


                         
          Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...

                          CATWOMAN
           Don't be shy.

                         
          ...Batman is there.

           83.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne says you can get me the
           'Clean Slate'.

                          BATMAN
           That depends.

                          CATWOMAN
           On what?

                          BATMAN
           On what you want it for. I acquired
           it to keep it out of the wrong
           hands.

                          CATWOMAN
           Still don't trust me, huh? How can
           we change that?

                          BATMAN
           Start by taking me to Bane.

                          CATWOMAN

                          (SHRUGS)
           You asked.
          Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
          into a service tunnel...

                         

                         

          INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.

                          CATWOMAN
           From here, Bane's men patrol the
           tunnels...and they are not your
           average brawlers.

                          BATMAN
           Neither am I.
          Catwoman swings into a -

                         

          INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.

                          CATWOMAN
           He's behind you.

           84.

                         

                         

                          MERCENARY

                          (SPINS)
           Who?
          Batman hangs upside down behind him.

                         

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Me.
          Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
          Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
          off his feet by darkness - he screams...
          Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
          Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.

                          CATWOMAN
           Just a little further.
          A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
          is deep inside.

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had to find a way to stop them
           trying to kill me.

                          BATMAN
           You've made a serious mistake.

           BANE (O.S.)
           Not as serious as yours, I fear.
          Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.

                          BATMAN
           Bane.

                          BANE
           Let's not stand on ceremony here,
           Mr. Wayne.

                         
          Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.
          Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
          his fist.

                          BANE
           Peace has cost you strength.
           Victory has defeated you.

           85.

                         

                         
          Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
          Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
          chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
          flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.

                         

                          BANE
           Theatricality and deception are
           powerful agents...to the
           uninitiated.
          Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.

                         

                          BANE
           But we are initiated, aren't we,
           Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
           you betrayed us...

                         

                          BATMAN
           Us? You were excommunicated. From a
           gang of psychopaths.

                          BANE
           Now I am the League of Shadows,
           here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's

                          A U
           destiny...
          Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
          waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
          Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.

                         
          Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
          Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...

                          BANE
           You fight like a younger man.
           Nothing held back. No reserves.
           Admirable. But mistaken.
          Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
          turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.

                         

                          BANE
           You think darkness is your ally.
           But you merely adopted the dark. I
           was born in it. Formed by it...

                         
          In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...

                          BANE
           I didn't see the light until I was
           already a man. And by then it was
           nothing to me but blinding...

           86.

                         

                         
          Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
          his grasp.

                          BANE
           The shadows betray you, because
           they belong to me...

                         
          Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
          pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
          Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
          chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...

                          BANE
           I will show you where I've made my
           home while preparing to bring
           justice. Then...I will break you.

                         
          A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through
          cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST
          over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing:
          Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's
          weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.

                          BATMAN
           No...

                          BANE
           Your precious armory. Gratefully

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches.

                         

                          BANE
           I wondered which would break first
           - your spirit...

                         
          Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him

          HIGH.
           ...or your body.
          Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
          with a horrific CRACK.

           87.

                         

                         
          In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
          pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
          Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the
          hollow eyes of his trophy...

                         
          Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -

           FADE TO BLACK.

          Blake's cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows.
          Nothing.

          Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat,
          bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab.

          Blake pulls out to follow.

                         

          INT. TERMINAL, GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop
          staring at her - ducks down a service hallway.

                         

          INT. SERVICE HALLWAY, AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying
          make-up.

           Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your
           ticket and identification, please.

                         
          Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.

                          SELINA
           Would you mind?

           88.

                         

                         
          She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the
          brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his
          head.

                         

                         

          INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the
          far end - turns - Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand.

                         

                         

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in.

                          BLAKE
           I showed your picture to the
           Congressman and guess what?

                          SELINA
           Don't tell me, still in love?

                          BLAKE
           Head over heels. Pressing charges,
           though.
          Blake lays a police file down with a thump.
           You've made some mistakes, Ms.
           Kyle.

                         

                          SELINA
           Girl's gonna eat.

                          BLAKE
           You have an appetite. Why run? You
           can't hide from us with this
           record.

                          SELINA
           Maybe it's not you I'm running
           from.

                          BLAKE
           Who then? Bane? What do you know
           about him?

                         

                          SELINA

                          (QUIET)
           That you should be as afraid of him
           as I am.

           89.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           We can offer you protection...
          Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
          off the tape, moves to the door.

                         

                          BLAKE
           When I spotted you, I was looking
           for a friend...Bruce Wayne.
          Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Did they kill him?

                          SELINA
           I'm not sure.

                         
          And we -

                          CUT TO:
          BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights:
          LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -

                         

          INT. STONE CELL - DAWN

          Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in
          the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is
          painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting
          at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.

                          WAYNE
           Why didn't you just kill me?

                         

                          BANE
           You don't fear death. You welcome
           it. Your punishment is to be more
           severe.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SCATHING)
           You're a torturer...

                          BANE
           Yes. But not of your body. Of your
           soul.
          Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.

           90.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Where am I?

                          BANE
           Home.

                         
          Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
          sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
           Where I learned the truth about
           despair. As will you. (Rises.)
           There is a reason that this prison
           is the worst hell on earth...
          Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
          hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
          well...
           Hope. Every man who has rotted here
           over the centuries has looked up to
           the light and imagined climbing to
           freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
           like shipwrecked men turning to sea
           water from uncontrollable thirst,
           many have died trying. I learned
           that there can be no true despair
           without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
           as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
           its people hope to poison their
           souls. I will let them believe they
           can survive so that you can watch
           them clamber over each other to
           stay in the sun...
          Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
           You will watch as I torture an
           entire city to cause you pain you
           thought you could never feel again.
           Then, when you have truly
           understood the depths of your
           failure, we will fulfill R¯'s al

                          A
           Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy

                          U
           Gotham. And when it is done...when
           Gotham is ashes...then you have my
           permission to die.
          Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.

                         

                         

          EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - DAY

          A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks
          up at the formidable grey building.

           91.

                         

          INT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

          Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls.

                         

                          GUARD
           We're locking her up in here?

                          WARDEN
           The Dent Act allows non-segregation
           based on extraordinary need. First
           time she broke out of women's
           correctional she was sixteen.
          Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...

                         

                          HUGE INMATE
           Little closer, baby...

                          SELINA
           Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?

                         
          Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands
          between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his
          arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...

                          WARDEN
           She'll be just fine.

                         

                         

          INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

          Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           I don't see the need for a board
           meeting on the energy project -

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce got a lot of things right.
           Keeping the board in the dark
           wasn't one of them...
          Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...

                         

                         

          INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

          The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table - Bane.

                          BANE
           This meeting is called to order.
          Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.

           92.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Chair and President. I also need
           one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,
           would you care to nominate?

                         

                          FREDERICKS
           No. I volunteer.
          The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
          Mercernaries round the three up.

                         

                          FOX
           Where are you taking us?

                          BANE
           Where you buried your resources.
           The bowels of Gotham.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Gordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated
          position as Blake watches.

                         

                          GORDON
           So you think our friend is gone
           again?

                          BLAKE

                          (GRAVE)
           This time...he might not be coming
           back.
          Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.

                         

                          FOLEY
           Okay, Commissioner, you were right.

                          GORDON
           What's happened?

                         

                          FOLEY
           Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne
           Enterprises board. He let most of
           them go, but took three down into
           the sewers.

                         

                          GORDON
           No more patrols, no more hide and
           seek. Send every available cop
           down there to smoke him out.

           93.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           The Mayor won't want panic -

                          BLAKE
           So it's a training exercise.

                         
          Foley looks at Gordon.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry for not taking you

                          SERIOUSLY -

                         

                          GORDON
           Don't apologize for believing the
           world's in better shape then it
           is...just fight to make it true.

                         
          Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.

                          GORDON
           Not you. You're telling me the
           Batman's gone. So you chase up the
           Daggett leads, any way you can.

                         
          Blake nods.

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his
          parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the
          wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He asks if you would pay us to let
           you die. I told him you have
           nothing.

                          WAYNE
           Do it for the pleasure.

                         
          The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.

                          PRISONER
           They pay me more than that to keep
           you alive.

                         
          A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully
          to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong
          Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other
          Prisoners.

           94.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He will try the climb.
          Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant
          grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.

                         
          Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot
          leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as
          Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he
          swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong
          Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Has anyone made it?

                          PRISONER
           Of course not.

                         
          The Blind Prisoner barks at him.

                          WAYNE
           What does he say?

                         

                          PRISONER
           He says there is one who did. A
           child...
          INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.

                         

                          PRISONER
           A child who had been born in this
           hell...

                          WAYNE
           Bane.

                         

                          PRISONER
           An old legend. Nothing more.
          The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Don't.

                          PRISONER
           Whatever they want you to
           see...it's happening soon.

          EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

          A SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing
          boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of
          Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking
          weapons, using flashlights...

          Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel
          follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox.

                          BANE
           Turn it on.

                         
          Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.

                          BANE
           I only need one other board member.
           There are eight more waiting
           upstairs.

                         

                          FOX
           I won't do it.
          Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Alright, stop.
          She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
          beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.

           96.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Lucius, you'll kill this man and
           yourself, and barely slow them
           down.
          Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
          Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel
          is transfixed.

                         

                          BANE
           Do your work.
          Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages.
           Take them to the surface. People of
           their status deserve to see the
           next era of western civilization.
          Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.

           We're seeing literally thousands of

                          MAYOR
           A training exercise, that's all. If

           I've been to half Daggett's cement
           plants, logged locations they've
           poured for underground

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Anything strange about the
           pourings?
          Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Honestly, Commissioner, I don't
           know anything about civil
           engineering.

                         

                          GORDON
           But you know about patterns. Keep

          Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.

           (to his men)
           Pull the core out of the reactor.

                         

           DR. PAVEL

                          (HORRIFIED)
           You can't. This is the only power
           source capable of sustaning it - if
           you move it, the core will decay in
           a matter of months.

                          BANE
           Five, by my calculations.

                         

           DR. PAVEL
           And then it will go off.

                          BANE
           For the sake of your family, Dr.
           Pavel, I hope so.

                         
          Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the
          core...

          Blake is led through a fence by a Worker.

                         

                          WORKER
           Boss is about to leave.
          Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Hey.
          The Driver turns.

                          BLAKE
           That was you outside the stock
           exchange, right?

                          DRIVER
           When?

                         

                          BLAKE
           When? When half the city's cops
           were trying to pull onto Castle
           Street and your truck shut them
           out.

                         

                          DRIVER
           Oh yeah. You're that cop -

                          BLAKE
           Detective, now.

                         
          Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...

                          BLAKE
           And as a detective...I'm not
           allowed to believe in coincidences

                          ANYMORE -
          Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
          knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him.
          The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the
          Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires
          behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one
          catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,
          gasping, kneels beside the Driver.

                          BLAKE
           What were you doing?! What?!

                         
          The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses
          is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.

          Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some
          empty barrels...
           Commissioner, they've got
           Polyisobutylene here... (Looks
           around.) And motor oil. They

           betrayed everything you stood for.

           (looks at Blake)
           There's a point. Far out there.
           When the structures fail you. When
           the rules aren't weapons anymore,
           they're shackles, letting the bad
           get ahead. Maybe one day you'll
           have such a moment of crisis. And
           in that moment, I hope you have a
           friend like I did. To plunge their
           hands into the filth so you can
           keep yours clean.

                          BLAKE
           Your hands look pretty filthy to
           me, Commissioner.

                          PRISONER
           He was the prison doctor. A

           displeasure of powerful people.
           Including your masked friend.

                          PRISONER
           Many years ago, during a time of
           plague, Bane was attacked by other
           prisoners. The doctor's fumbling
           attempts to repair the damage left
           him in perpetual agony. The mask
           holds his pain at bay.

                          WAYNE
           Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was
           he born here?

                         

                          PRISONER
           The legend is that there was a
           mercenary working for the local
           warlord who fell in love with his
           daughter. They married in secret.

                         
          The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms.

                          PRISONER
           When the warlord found out, he
           condemned the mercenary to this
           pit. But then exiled him instead.

           The mercenary understood that the
           warlord's daughter had secured his
           release, but he couldn't know the
           true price of his freedom. She had
           taken his place in the pit.

           innocence was their redemption. The
           mother was not so lucky.
          The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods.

                         

                          PRISONER
           This is Bane's prison now. Bane
           would not want this story told.
          The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled
          upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine.
           You have a protruding
           vertebra...I'm going to force it
           back...

           How -?

                         
          The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams.

                          PRISONER
           You stay like this. Until you
           stand.

           'Storm's coming', remember? This is
           what you wanted.

                         

                          SELINA
           No. It's what I thought I wanted.

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          The Prisoner unties the rope from Wayne's chest. Wayne
          stands. Just. Then walks.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER


                         
          Wayne does push-ups. Stronger. The Prisoner watches.

                          PRISONER
           Why build yourself?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not meant to die in here.
          The Prisoner indicates the TV:

           118.

                         

                         

          SIEGE OF GOTHAM: DAY 84.

                          PRISONER
           Here? There? What's the difference?
          Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body...

                         

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

          Wayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed
          Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners
          gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the
          light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners
          get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands.
          Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the
          next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS.
          His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet -
          the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The
          Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner
          lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away.

                         

                          PRISONER
           I told you it could not be done.

                          WAYNE
           You told me a child did it...

                         

                          PRISONER
           No ordinary child...
          INSERT CUT: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child,
          older now, moves to the climbing wall
           A child born in hell.
          INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down
          - making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off
          Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn.
           A child forged by suffering,
           hardened by pain...
          INSERT CUT: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a
          handhold on the ledge and swinging up...
           Not a man from privilege.

                         
          Wayne's eyes close in despair.

          EXT. CHECKPOINT, GOTHAM BRIDGE - DAY

          Supply trucks await inspection. Mercenaries open an
          18-wheeler - check boxes of rations...wave it on...

                         

                         

          EXT. SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

          The 18-wheeler pulls up. A line of Gothamites waits
          patiently along the sidewalk.

                         

                         

          INT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

          Three plain-clothes Special Forces Men emerge from the
          boxes, checking, then concealing weapons. The doors open -
          they exit.

                         

                         

          INT. SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

          The Special Forces Men carry boxes into the store as if
          delivering. The Store Manager leads them into the back and
          down into -

                         

          INT. LOWER STOREROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Where they are met by four Cops out of uniform.

                         

                          FOLEY
           You have ID?

                          SPECIAL FORCES 1
           Of course not.

                         

                          FOLEY
           How can we trust you?

           GORDON (O.S.)
           We don't have any choice.

                         
          Gordon and Blake emerge from the back of the room.

                          SPECIAL FORCES 1
           Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones,
           Special Forces.

                         

                          GORDON
           Captain, glad to have you here.

           120.

                         

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           How many of you are there?

                          GORDON
           Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly.
           But the men trapped underground
           number almost three thousand.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What kind of shape they're in?

                         

                          GORDON
           They've been getting water, food.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could we break them out?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries
           guarding the outflow south of
           Ackerman Park, blow the rubble,
           you've got a hole big enough for
           ten at a time. I'm in contact with
           my partner - they're waiting for
           the day.

                          SPECIAL FORCES 2
           Men who haven't seen daylight for
           three months?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Men with automatic weapons who
           haven't seen daylight in three
           months.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What about the bomb? The satellites
           can't see any radiation hot
           spots...

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

          Blake scouts with Jones. A rumble makes them turn.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           They keep it on a truck - it must
           have a lead-lined roof. They move
           it constantly.

           CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.)
           But you know the truck?

           121.

                         

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           They've got three of them. The
           routes don't vary much.
          Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street.
          Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger
          counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers
          stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.

                         

          INT. LOWER STOREROOM - CONTINUOUS


                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           What about the triggerman?

                          GORDON
           No leads. It's a bluff - Bane
           wouldn't give control of that bomb
           to someone else.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We can't take that chance. Until we
           have the triggerman, we just track
           the device, smuggle men over -

                          BLAKE
           While Gotham lives under a warlord,
           like in some failed state?

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Dial it back, officer. This
           situation is unprecedented. We
           can't do anything to risk millions
           of lives.

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (TO GORDON)
           Aren't you gonna tell him?!

                          GORDON
           Captain, things are more
           complicated than you think. There's
           somebody you need to meet. Blake?
          Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.

                         

                         

          EXT. SIDE STREET, DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS

          Blake leads them to the door of an empty bank.

          INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

          They head across the empty lobby to an elevator.

                         

          INT. OFFICES ABOVE TELLSONS - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Blake leads them into empty offices. Cots and makeshift
          furnishings line the offices and corridors.

                          BLAKE
           I was up here looking for a vantage
           point. Found the people who run the
           corporation who owns it living
           here.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Which corporation?

           FOX (O.S.)
           Wayne Enterprises.
          Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd
           like you to brief the Captain.
          Captain Jones indicates Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           Miss Tate is fully aware of the
           situation.

                          MIRANDA
           And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
           have to take responsibility for it.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Why?

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Because, Captain, we built it.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           You built the bomb?

                         

                          FOX
           It was built as a fusion reactor.
           The first of its kind. Bane turned
           the core into a bomb, then
           disconnected it from the reactor.

           123.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           And here's the important part.

                          FOX
           As the device's fuel cells decay,
           it's becoming increasingly
           unstable...until the point of
           detonation.

                          BLAKE
           The bomb's a time bomb.

                         

                          FOX
           And it will go off. In twenty-three
           days.
          Captain Jones reels at this news.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Bane's revolution is a sham. He's
           watching Gotham rearrange its
           deckchairs while the whole ship's
           going down. Your appeasement plan
           might not be as practical as you
           thought.
          Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could you disarm it?

                          FOX
           I don't know, But I could reconnect
           it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We'd have to let the Pentagon know.

                          SPECIAL FORCES 2
           They'll be monitoring our

                          FREQUENCIES -

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We have no choice. Let's move away
           from this location, then call it
           in.

          Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and
          Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose.
          Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes
          a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator.

          Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other

          his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones
          looks up at him, defiant.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES

          Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.

                          MERCERNARY
           There were people living upstairs.

                         
          Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.

          INT. SAME - LATER


                         
          Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind
          Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He says the leap to freedom is not
           about strength.

                         

                          WAYNE
           My body makes the jump.

                          BLIND PRISONER

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           Survival is the spirit. The soul.

                          WAYNE
           My soul's as ready to escape as my
           body.

                         

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Fear is why you fail.

                          WAYNE
           I'm not afraid. I'm angry.

                         
          Wayne throws punches...focused.

                         

          INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners
          look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts
          climbing, determined.
          He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
          it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
          face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
          A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
          at Wayne, hanging upside down.

                          SKINNY PRISONER
           Shouldn't you get him down?
          The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.

           126.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He'll keep.
          As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -
          INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well,
          looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.

           THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.)
           And why do we fall?

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT

          Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.

                          BLIND PRISONER

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           You do not fear death. You think
           this makes you strong. This makes
           you weak.

                          WAYNE
           Why?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           How can you move faster then
           possible? Fight longer than
           possible? If not from the most
           powerful impulse of the spirit. The
           fear of death. The will to survive.
          Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.

                          WAYNE
           I do fear death. I fear dying in
           here while my city burns with no
           one there to save it.

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Then make the climb.

                          WAYNE
           How?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           As the child did. Without the rope.
           (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find
           you again.
          Wayne considers this.

           127.

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - MORNING

          Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
          folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.

                          PRISONER
           Supplies for your journey?
          Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
          Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
          Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
          to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
          makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
          below the Prisoners start a low chant.
          As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
          EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
          circle up to the opening above...
          Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
          breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
          again...then he jumps.

                         
          Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
          And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
          The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
          ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.
          He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached
          to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

          A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,
          industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down
          into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is
          Stryver, Daggett's functionary.

                          STRYVER
           I want to see Bane! There's been a
           mistake! Take me to Bane!
          Fox watches him dragged upstairs...

           128.

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - MOMENTS LATER

          A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.

                          STRYVER
           There's been a mistake! Where's
           Bane?!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           There's been no mistake, Mr.
           Stryver.

                         
          Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.

                          CRANE
           You are Philip Stryver, executive
           vice-president of Daggett
           Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)
           The same Philip Stryver who for
           years lived like a prince off the
           blood and sweat of people less
           powerful?

                         

                          STRYVER
           Call Bane! I'm one of you!
          Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.

                          CRANE
           Bane has no authority here. This is
           merely a sentencing hearing. The
           choice is yours, death or exile.
          Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
          'Death'.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Exile.

                          CRANE

                          (SMASHES GAVEL)
           Sold...to the man in the cold
           sweat!
          Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY

          Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the
          ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering.

           129.

                         

                         

                          BLACKGATE INMATE
           Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -
           you're dead in minutes.

                          STRYVER
           Has anyone made it?
          The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
          ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking...
          Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.

                         

                         

          INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit
          around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch.

                         

                          GORDON
           Where the hell are they? It's not
           like we have a lot of time, here.

                          COP
           How long?

                          GORDON
           The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've
           got about eighteen hours to do
           something.

                         

                          COP
           To do what?

                          GORDON
           We mark that truck. Get a GPS on
           it, then we can start thinking
           about how to take it down.
          The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops.
          Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.

                         

                          GORDON

                          (LOW)
           That's it?
          Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.

                         

                          GORDON
           Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?!
          Gordon heads for the door.

           130.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           You shouldn't be out on the streets

                          -

                         

                         

          EXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

          Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.

                          FOLEY'S WIFE
           Jim. He's not here -

                         
          Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.

                          GORDON
           You're sending your wife to the
           door when the city's under
           occupation?!
          Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.

                          FOLEY
           Wait in the kitchen, honey.

                         

                          GORDON
           What did you do, bury your uniform
           in the backyard?

                          FOLEY
           Jim, you saw what they did to those
           Special Forces.

                          GORDON
           You forgotten all the years we went
           out on patrol with every gangbanger
           wanting to plant one as soon as our
           backs were turned?

                          FOLEY
           This is different and you know it.
           These guys run the city - the
           government's done a deal with them

                          -

                          GORDON
           Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a
           vice. That's not a deal -

                          FOLEY
           You move against Bane, the
           triggerman's gonna hit the button -

           131.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           You think he's given control of
           that bomb to one of 'the people'?!
           You think this is part of some
           revolution? There's one man with
           his finger on the button - Bane.

                          FOLEY
           We have to keep our heads down
           until they can fix this. If you
           still had family here maybe you'd -

                         

                          GORDON
           This only gets fixed from inside
           the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,
           I'm not asking you to walk down
           Grand in your dress blues. But
           we've got to do something before
           this maniac blows us all to hell.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -

                         

                          GORDON
           Keep your head down? What's that
           gonna do tomorrow, when that thing
           blows?

                          FOLEY
           You don't know that's going to
           happen.
          Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           I hear you're looking for men,
           Commissioner.
          Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           How about me, instead?

                          GORDON
           Miss Tate, I can't ask you -

                         

                          MIRANDA
           My company built it.

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne built it.

           132.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And he wanted to destroy it. It was
           me who didn't listen. Please.
          Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.

                         

                          GORDON
           Let's go.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two
          Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.

                          GANGBANGER
           You steal from us, you little
           bastard?
          They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
          apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is
          grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.
          Selina catches the apple.

                         

                          SELINA
           You boys know you can't come into
           my neighborhood without asking
           politely.

                         
          Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him
          stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,
          howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.

                          SELINA
           Never steal anything from someone
           you can't outrun, kid.

                          KID
           Now you're gonna take it.

                         
          Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.

                          SELINA
           Just tax.
          She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.

                         

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           Pretty generous, for a thief.
          Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
          but weathered. Beard, work clothes.

           133.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           You came back. I thought they'd
           killed you.

                          WAYNE
           Not yet.

                          SELINA
           If you're expecting an apology -

                          WAYNE
           It wouldn't suit you. I need your
           help.

                          SELINA
           And why would I help you?

                         
          Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.

                          WAYNE
           For this. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          SELINA
           You're gonna trust me with that?
           After what I did to you?

                          WAYNE
           I admit I felt a little let down.
           But I still think there's more to
           you. In fact, I think for you -
           (indicates USB) this isn't a tool,
           it's an escape route. You want to
           disappear. Start fresh.

                         
          She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.

                          SELINA
           Start fresh? I can't even get off
           this island.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I can give you a way off. Once
           you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I
           need you to find out where they're
           holding him. Then take me in.

                         

                          SELINA
           Why do you need Fox?

                          WAYNE
           To save this city.

           134.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Who says it needs saving? Maybe I
           like it this way.

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you do. But tomorrow that
           bomb's going off.

                          SELINA
           Get your powerful friend on the
           case.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm trying. But I need Fox.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY


                         
          Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking
          down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.

                          GORDON
           Stay further up the block. (Points
           at Men.) They're gonna cross the
           street and try and slow the truck
           down. As it approaches, hit this
           button. If the needle hits two
           hundred - give me the signal and I
           mark the truck. Okay?

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (OVER RADIO)
           Heads up.

                         
          Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end
          of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men
          walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the
          road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the
          signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS
          locator at the lower part of the truck...

                         
          Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.

                          GORDON
           Got it.

                         
          They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an
          ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.

                          MERCENARY
           Commissioner Gordon, you're under
           arrest.

           135.

                         

                          GORDON
           On whose authority?

                          MERCERNARY
           The people of Gotham.

                         
          Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and
          the other Cops being rounded up and led away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY


                         
          Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come
          down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They
          kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to
          his aid.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 1
           Find this one a spot, he's got a
           big day tomorrow.
          They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 2
           We all do. It's not every day you
           bag Bruce Wayne...
          Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods
          at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda
          comes over.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce?

                         

                          FOX
           You picked a hell of a time to go
           on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           How long until the core ignites?

                         

                          FOX
           That bomb goes off in twelve hours.

                          WAYNE
           Unless we can connect it to the
           reactor.

                          FOX
           If you can get it there. I'll find
           a way to plug it back in.
           (Indicates Miranda.) Can you get
           Miranda out?

           136.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Not tonight. I'm sorry.

                          MIRANDA
           Do what's necessary.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (TO FOX)
           Tonight I need you.

                          FOX
           What for?

                          WAYNE
           To get me back in the game.
          Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to spoil things, boys, but
           Bane wants these guys himself...
          The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
          up.

                          WAYNE
           I won't forget about you.

                          MIRANDA
           I know.

                         

          EXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman
          spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to
          the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.

                          FOX
           I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           He should be so lucky.
          And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.

                         

                         

          INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

          Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.

           137.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Any move I make against Bane or the
           bomb - the triggerman sets it off.

                          FOX
           They can't be using radio or cell -
           too much interference. Infrared
           doesn't have the range. It could
           only be micro-burst long wave...
          Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment:
          mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...

                          WAYNE
           Could you block it?

                          FOX
           Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance
           mount from the Bat. You remember
           where you parked?
          Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING (LATE DAY)

          Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides.

                          CRANE
           The charges are espionage and
           attempted sabotage... Do you have
           anything to say in your defense?

                          GORDON
           No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort
           of due process is this?

                          CRANE
           More than you give Harvey's
           prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt
           is determined, this is merely a
           sentencing hearing. What's it to
           be, death or exile?

                          GORDON
           Crane, if you think we are going
           willingly out onto that ice, you've
           got another think coming.

                          CRANE
           Death, then?

           138.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           Looks that way.

                          CRANE
           Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By
           exile.

                         
          He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men,
          indicates Miranda.

                          BANE
           Bring her to me.

          Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath

                         

                          LUCIUS
           I think it's time to talk about my

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun
          sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.

                          FOX
           She fly pretty well?

                          WAYNE
           Even without the autopilot...

                          FOX
           Autopilot? That's what you're there

          Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.
          A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,
          then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...
          Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of
          liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Light it up.

           139.

                         

                         
          Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -
          jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the
          ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a

          BAT...

          Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.

           Sir?

                         
          Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.

                          MERCENARY
           You think it's really him?

          Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them
          moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a
          dark figure. The figure steps into the light - it is

          Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open
          manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb
          out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake
          is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,
          sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops
          onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman
          takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is
          finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.

                          BLAKE
           You missed a spot.
          Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.

                         

                          BATMAN
           If you're working alone, wear a
           mask.

                          BLAKE
           No one cares who I am.

                          BATMAN
           The mask is not for you. It's to
           protect the people you care about.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Huh. And you always seem to know
           where those people are. How is
           that?

                          BATMAN
           I lost someone once. Since then I
           break into their homes when they're
           sleeping and implant a tracking
           device on the back of their neck.

                         
          Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses
          Blake a mini-mine.

           141.

                         

                         

                          BATMAN
           On three - one, two, three -
          They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
          the blasts barely move any rubble.

                         

                          BLAKE
           No offense, but you got anything
           bigger in that belt?

                          BATMAN
           That's to warn the men on the other
           side.
          Batman disappears into the shadows.

                          BLAKE
           But how do we -?
          KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.

                          BLAKE
           Okay.

                         
          Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but
          glad to be alive and carrying guns...

                          BLAKE
           What now?

                         

                          BATMAN
           All-out assault on Bane...but you
           need to get the people you care
           about across the bridge.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          BATMAN
           In case we fail. Lead an exodus
           across the bridge. Save as many
           lives as you can.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you need me here?

                         

                          BATMAN
           You've given me an army. Now go.
          Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.

           142.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Thank you.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Don't thank me yet.

                          BLAKE
           I might not get a chance later.

                         
          Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at
          his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,
          revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up.

                          CATWOMAN
           Oh, you shouldn't have...
          She hops on, feeling the controls.

                         

                          BATMAN
           The mid-town tunnel's blocked by
           debris, but the cannons give you
           enough firepower to make a path for
           people.

                         
          Catwoman marvels at the controls...

                          BATMAN
           To start it, you -

                         

          VARROOOM!

                          CATWOMAN
           I got it.

                         

                          BATMAN
           We've got forty-five minutes to
           save this city -

                          CATWOMAN
           No, I've got forty-five minutes to
           get clear of the blast radius,
           because you don't stand a chance
           against these guys.

           143.

                         

                          BATMAN
           With your help I might.

                         
          She shakes her head.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'll open that tunnel, then I'm
           gone.

                         
          He looks at her.

                          BATMAN
           There's more to you than that.
          She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to keep letting you down.
          He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.
           Come with me. Save yourself. You
           don't owe these people anymore -
           you've given them everything...

                          BATMAN
           Not everything. Not yet.

                         
          Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the
          bike and takes off.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT


                         
          Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the
          tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN


                         
          The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the
          op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the
          building, forming up into an opposing line.
          A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.
          The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -
          until two Tumblers arrive.

                          VOICE

                          (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

           DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED

           UPON.
          The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.

           144.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           There's only one police in this
           city.
          He steps forward. The line follows.

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.

                         

                          BANE
           Open fire.

                         

          EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into
          the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter -
          WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and
          BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES
          and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until
          they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is
          filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel
          blockage...the dust settles. Her path is clear.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon heard the fighting. Checks the box. Nervous.

                         

                          GORDON
           Come on, come on...

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and
          right. A space clears - he is face the face with the
          Batman...

                         

                          BANE
           You came back. To die with your
           city.

                          BATMAN
           No. I came back to stop you.

           145.

                         

                         
          Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head.
          Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side.
          Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in
          a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck
          smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in,
          blasting at the Guards. Gordon opens the back - empty. No
          bomb. Wrong truck.

                          GORDON
           That's impossible... Come on! Cut
           over to Fifth!

                         
          They sprint for the next parallel avenue...

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Fox hurries into the reactor - starts throwing switches...

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - CONTINUOUS

          Blake leads the boys out of the home - points down the
          street.

                          BLAKE
           Knock on doors, spread the word -
           the bomb's going to blow! Get out
           by the South Street tunnel, or over
           the bridge! Do two blocks, then get
           back to the bus!
          The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the
          bus.

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler
          roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.

           146.

                         

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane SMASHES backwards through the door, Batman on him.
          Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries
          guarding Miranda move towards them -

                         

                          BANE
           Stay back. He is mine -
          Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but
          Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the
          tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane
          bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a
          hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.

                          BATMAN
           Give me the trigger! You'd never
           give it to an ordinary citizen -
          Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through
          pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for
          relief.

                         

                          BANE
           I broke you. How have you come
           back?

                          BATMAN
           You thought you were the only one
           who could learn the strength to
           escape?
          Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.

                         

                          BANE
           I never escaped - R¯'s al Gh¯l

                          A U
           rescued me. That is why I must
           fulfill his plan. That is why I
           must avenge his murder.

                         

                          BATMAN

                          (CONFUSED)
           The child of R¯'s al Gh¯l made the

                          CLIMB -

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           But he is not the child of R¯'s al

                          A
           Gh¯l...

                          U
          Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear...

           147.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           I am.
          Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs...
           And though I am not 'ordinary', I
           am a citizen...

                         
          She pulls out the trigger...

          Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street.
          His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the
          back. The truck accelerates - Gordon drops, hanging on to
          the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on...

                         

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the
          throat, but Miranda has her knife in his side -

                         

                          MIRANDA/TALIA
           My mother named me Talia before she
           was killed. The way I would've been
           killed if not for my
           protector...Bane.

           He saw only a monster who could
           never be tamed. Whose very
           existence was a reminder of the
           hell he'd left his wife to die in.
           He excommunicated Bane from the
           League of Shadows. His only crime
           was that he loved me. I could not
           truly forgive my father...

          Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a
          Mercenary - points it at Batman.

                          TALIA
           Not yet... I want him to feel the
           heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of

          Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes,
          tenderly.

                          GORDON
           Give me a hand!
          The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try
          and grab the core but it is too hot.
           Let's get a cable on it and drag it
           out! Come on, we're almost there -
          Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
          Dying.

                          TALIA
           Fox showed me how to operate the
           reactor core. Including the
           emergency flood -

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater -

                         

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.

                          TALIA
           There is no way to stop this bomb.
           Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at
           Batman.) My father's work is done.

                         
          Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -
          Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to
          attach a hoist from the Bat.

                          GORDON
           What're you doing?

                          BATMAN
           Two minutes. I can fly it out over
           the bay...

                         
          Catwoman is at his side as he works.

                          CATWOMAN
           Rig it out to fly over the water,
           then bail -

           156.

                         

                         

                          BATMAN
           No autopilot.
          She takes this in. He stands to face her.

                          CATWOMAN
           You could've gone anywhere. Been
           anything. But you came back here.

                          BATMAN
           So did you.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           I guess we're both suckers.
          She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
          to the Bat, Gordon alongside.

                         

                          GORDON
           So this is the part where you
           vanish, only this time you don't
           come back?

                         
          Batman opens the canopy.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Come on! On the bus!

                          FATHER REILLY
           What're you doing?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Protection from the blast -

                          FATHER REILLY
           It's an atom bomb -!

                         
          Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious.

                          BLAKE
           You think they need to hear that in
           their last seconds? You think I'm
           going to let them die without hope?

           157.

                         

                         

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon puts a hand on Batman's arm.

                          GORDON
           I never cared who you were -

                         

                          BATMAN
           And you were right.

                          GORDON
           But shouldn't the people know the
           hero who saved them?

                          BATMAN
           A hero can be anyone. That was
           always the point.

                         
          Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
           Anyone. A man doing something as
           simple and reassuring as putting a
           coat around a little boy's
           shoulders to let him know that the
           world hadn't ended...
          The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers

                         -
          INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
          around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
          loving.
          Gordon looks up to the cockpit -

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne?
          - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
          out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
          tunnel mouth.

                         
          The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
          building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
          there's no power to get over it.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake shouts into the bus -

                          BLAKE
           Heads down! Heads down, now!

           158.

                         

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Blake, they need to make their
           peace.
          Blake turns to him, furious.

                         

                          BLAKE
           They're children! They have no
           peace to make -
          An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
          startled, turns to the children on the bus.
           Get down! This is it!
          The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
          Blake.

                         

                          LITTLE BOY
           No. That's Batman!
          Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
          Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
          dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
          of the river...the bay...the ocean...
          Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
          - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
          over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...

                         
          As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
          inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
          boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see a beautiful city and a
           brilliant people rising from this
           abyss...'
          Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see the lives for which I lay
           down my life, peaceful, useful,
           prosperous and happy...'

                         

                         

          EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is
          Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is
          there, whose face we do not yet see...

           159.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           'I see that I hold a sanctuary in
           their hearts, and in the hearts of
           their descendants, generations
           hence. It is a far, far better
           thing that I do, than I have ever
           done...'
          Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
           'It is a far, far better rest that
           I go to than I have ever known.'

                         
          Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
          Alfred. Tears streaming.
          Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
          Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
          family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
          Thomas and Martha Wayne.

                          ALFRED
           I'm so sorry. I failed you. You
           trusted me, and I failed you.
          And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.

          Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side.

                          GORDON
           Can I change your mind about
           quitting the force?

                         

                          BLAKE
           No. What you said about structures.
           About shackles. I can't take it.
           The injustice. (Gestures at
           gardens.) I mean...no one's ever
           going to know who saved an entire
           city.

                          GORDON
           They know. (Off look.) It was
           Batman.

          Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue
          being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in
          granite. We move in on the stone face...

                         

           VOICE (V.O.)

          The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small
          group.

                          LAWYER
           Nonetheless, there are considerable

          A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children

          wide-eyed.
           The housing and care of the city's

          Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.

                          BLAKE
           Try my legal name.

                         
          The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.

                          CLERK
           Yup, here it is.

                         
          She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various
          items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.

                          CLERK
           You should use your full name. I
           like that name... Robin.

           162.

                         
          Blake smiles, embarrassed. Leaves.

                          LAWYER
           Any word on the missing item?

                          CLERK
           No, not yet.

                          LAWYER
           Well, they'd better leave no stone

                          TECH 1
           Why worry about the stabilization

           Please, I just need to know what I
           could've done to fix it.

                          TECH 2
           But Mr. Fox, it's already been
           fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software
           patch...six months ago.

          Blake sits in his car looking at a GPS device, puzzled.
          Beside him, the sports bag, open. In it is a piece of paper
          with coordinates, on top of some climbing rope and shackles.
          Blake gets out of the car with the bag. Follows the GPS into

          Alfred, paper under his arm, heads to his usual table. Sits.

                          WAITER
           Lei e solo?

                         

                          ALFRED
           Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia.

                         

                         

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Blake finds a large waterfall... He checks his GPS,
          confused. Stares at the waterfall. Reaches for the climbing
          gear...

                         

                         

          EXT. MCU - NIGHT

          Gordon steps onto the roof with his pile of arrest
          reports...

                         

                         

          EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

          As Alfred sips his drink, he glances up at a couple at the
          next table. Strangers. Alfred looks back down...

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          Moving in on the waterfall from inside... Blake bursts
          through, landing painfully on the shale inside. he gets to
          his feet, moving cautiously into the cave...

                         

                         

          EXT. MCU - NIGHT

          Gordon bangs his files against the air duct, straightening
          them. He stops. Sees something. The searchlight...fixed.
          Gordon runs his fingers across a brand new, steel Bat
          symbol... He looks up into the night...

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY


                         
          Blake lights his torch...then ducks, crouching, as THOUSANDS
          of SCREECHING creatures descend. BATS...

           164.

          Alfred folds his paper. Pulls out his money, then stops,
          seeing...across the tables, a familiar couple... Bruce
          smiles at Alfred, who nods. Bruce turns back to the pretty
          brunette in pearls. Selina. Alfred pays his bill, content.

          Blake lifts his head, FEELING the bats all around him...
          Blake RISES, and is SWALLOWED by the darkness of their wings
          and we -

Christopher Nolan
SHOOTING SCRIPT
FADE IN:
DAWN. CRASHING SURF.
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.
A CHILD’S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He
COLLAPSES.
The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.
INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER
The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.
ATTENDANT
(in Japanese)
He was delirious. But he asked for
you by name. And...
(to the Security Guard)
Show him.
SECURITY GUARD
(in Japanese)
He was carrying nothing but this...
He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.
SECURITY GUARD
...and this.
The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
(in Japanese)
Bring him here. And some food.
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER
The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
(in English)
Are you here to kill me?
The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
forefinger.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
I know what this is.
He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
I’ve seen one before. Many, many
years ago...
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
It belonged to a man I met in a
half-remembered dream...
MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
A man possessed of some radical
notions...
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...
COBB (V.O.)
What’s the most resilient parasite?
CUT TO:
INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)
The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.
COBB
A bacteria? A virus?
Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-
COBB
An intestinal worm?
Saito’s fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at
the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-
ARTHUR
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
COBB
An idea.
Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
2.
COBB
Resilient, highly contagious. Once
an idea’s taken hold in the brain
it’s almost impossible to
eradicate. A person can cover it
up, ignore it- but it stays there.
SAITO
But surely-to forget...?
COBB
Information, yes. But an idea?
Fully formed, understood? That
sticks...
(taps forehead)
In there, somewhere.
SAITO
For someone like you to steal?
ARTHUR
Yes. In the dream state, conscious
defenses are lowered and your
thoughts become vulnerable to
theft. It’s called extraction.
COBB
But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from
even the most skilled extractor.
SAITO
How can you do that?
COBB
Because I am the most skilled
extractor. I know how to search
your mind and find your secrets. I
know the tricks, and I can teach
them to your subconscious so that
even when you’re asleep, your guard
is never down.
Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito’s gaze.
COBB
But if I’m going to help you, you
have to be completely open to me.
I’ll need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your
wife, your analyst, anyone.
(gestures around)
If this is a dream and you’ve got a
safe full of secrets, I need to
know what’s in that safe. For this
to work, you have to let me in.
3.
Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.
SAITO
Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
consider your proposal.
They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-
ARTHUR
He knows.
Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS
FROZEN.
ARTHUR
What’s going on up there?
And we-
CUT TO:
FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)
Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.
A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD
CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.
Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-
THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.
Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.
Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to
his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)
Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train
BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
4.
A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.
Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP− Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-
NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.
ARTHUR
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
COBB
I can get it here. The
information's in the safe− he
looked right at it when I mentioned
secrets.
Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.
ARTHUR
What's she doing here, Cobb?
Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.
COBB
You just get to your room. I'll
take care of the rest.
ARTHUR
See that you do. We're here to
work.
Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIRMAL
If I jumped, would I survive?
5.
COBB
With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
why are you here?
She turns to look at him. Amused.
MAL
I thought you might be missing
me...
She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.
COBB
I am. But I can't trust you
anymore.
She stares up at him, inviting.
MAL
So what?
INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER
Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis
Bacon.
MAL
Looks like Arthur's taste.
Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.
COBB
Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to
postwar British painters.
He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.
COBB
Would you sit down?
Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.
MAL
Tell me...
Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.
MAL
Do the children miss me?
Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.
6.
COBB
You can't imagine.
Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.
MAL
What're you doing?
Cobb tosses the rope out-
COBB
Getting some air.
He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.
COBB
Stay seated. Please.
And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.
EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS
Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-
Suddenly he starts DROPPINGINT.
BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-
EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS
Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.
INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened
kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER
onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.
INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS
Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...
The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...
Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
7.
PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it
from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.
LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.
SAITO (O.S.)
Turn around.
Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.
MAL
The gun, Dom.
Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.
MAL
Please.
Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY
down the length or the table.
SAITO
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands
raised.
COBB
Did she tell you, or have you known
all along?
SAITO
That you're here to steal from me?
(beat)
Or that we're actually asleep?
Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.
SAITO
I want to know who your employer
is.
Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
8.
COBB
No point threatening him in a
dream.
MAL
That depends on what you're
threatening. Killing him would just
wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
the mind...
Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur
drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.
MAL
And, judging by the decor, we're in
your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...
Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYESArthur
DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE− Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at
the ceiling, DEAD, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY
Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-
NASH
What're you doing?! It's too soon-
FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.
ARTHUR
I know! We have to reconnect the
loop before they wake up!
Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom− following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-
CUT TO:
INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the
building BUCKS and HEAVES-
9.
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the
destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.
MAL
He was close. Very close.
EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPEINT.
DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He
looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-
SAITO
Stop him!
Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.
Mal smiles, amused.
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS
from his envelope, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,
SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the
machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-
ARTHUR
I'm not going to make it! Wake
Cobb!
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the
face, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...
10.
INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE
floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN. AWAKE.
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nash SMACKS Cobb again-
NASH
He won't wake!
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-CONTINUOUS
Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.
ARTHUR
Dunk him!
A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head
and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM
BACKWARDS− as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we
are in SLOW MOTION, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the
last sheet of paper. He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit
around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-
CUT TO:
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY
Cobb in SLOW MOTION, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he
goes under- and we-
CUT TO:
INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH
ALL THE WINDOWS, FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-
11.
COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE
PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...
HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THEINT.
FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY
Cobb’s AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.
Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb
LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across
the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS,
Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is
over.
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his
hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds
of RIOTING grow louder.
COBB
You came prepared.
SAITO
I bring the gun because not even my
head of security knows this
apartment. How did you find it?
Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.
COBB
Hard for a man in your position to
keep a love nest totally secret...
particularly when there's a married
woman involved.
SAITO
She would never...
COBB
And yet, here we are.
Saito is silent.
COBB
With a dilemma.
SAITO
You got what you came for.
COBB
Not quite. The key piece of
information wasn't there, was it,
Mr. Saito?
12.
Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried.
ARTHUR
They're getting closer, Cobb.
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then
pulls out an MP3 player and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Saito's eyes are on the floor.
COBB
You held something back because you
knew what we were up to...
Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.
COBB
So why let us in at all?
Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...
SAITO
An audition.
COBB
Audition for what?
SAITO
It doesn't matter. You failed.
COBB
I extracted all the information you
had in there.
SAITO
But your deception was readily
apparent.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Todashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex
mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERS
DISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.
13.
Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS
PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he
RAISES the volume...
Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's
"Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL
start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...
SAITO
So leave me and go.
COBB
You know the corporation who hired
us won't accept failure. We won't
last two days...
The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the
SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its
SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.
ARTHUR
Come on, Cobb.
COBB
So now I have to do this the oldfashioned
way-
Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-
When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING.
SAITO
I've always hated this carpet.
Cobb’s eyes flick to the carpet and back.
SAITO
It's stained and frayed in such
distinctive ways...
Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.
SAITO
But very definitely made of wool.
Right now I'm lying on polyester.
14.
Cobb glares at Nash, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He
looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY
Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.
SAITO
Which means I'm not lying on my
carpet, in my apartment...
(smiles)
You've lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming.
Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes.
TODASHI
How'd it go?
ARTHUR
Not good.
Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.
SAITO
A dream within a dream-I'm
impressed.
Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The
music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-
CUT TO:
15.
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the
next countdown hit ZERO, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches
Cobb. Nash is behind Saito.
SAITO
But in my dream, we really ought to
be playing by my rules...
NASH
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-
Saito turns to Nash-
COBB
We're not in your dream-
Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHEDNASH
We're in mine.
Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS
RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS
GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in
the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-
CUT TO:
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
Nash’ eyes open, AWAKE.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
Asshole!
Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.
ARTHUR
How could you get the carpet
wrong?!
NASH
It wasn't my fault!
ARTHUR
You're the architect-
16.
NASH
I didn't know he was going to rub
his damn cheek on it!
Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.
COBB
Lets go.
ARTHUR
And you-what the hell was all that?
COBB
I had it under control.
ARTHUR
I’d hate to see out of control-
COBB
There's no time for this-I'm
getting off at Kyoto.
ARTHUR
Why? He's not gonna search every
compartment.
COBB
I can't stand trains.
Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.
ARTHUR
I can keep him under for one minute-
Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape
off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the
silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-
COBB
Every man for himself.
Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down
the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks
at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.
EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS
The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Saito WAKES GENTLY. Looks around the compartment, empty but
for Todashi, reading a comic. Saito looks down at his wrist.
Sees a small mark. Rubs it. SMILES.
17.
EXT. TOKYO - DUSK
Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER
thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.
INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO - CONTINUOUS
Cobb sits, waiting. Checks his watch, restless. He pulls a
HANDGUN. Checks it is loaded. places it on the table in front
of him. Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
table ... He INTENT STUDIES the top's spin... As he stares,
the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the top
WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS.
the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-
CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad.
COBB
Hey, guys. How are you?
CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
Good. Okay, I guess.
Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT
CUT: COBB's MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards us,
crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...
COBB
Who's just okay? Was that James?
JAMES (over phone)
Yeah. When are you coming home?
COBB
I can't. Not for a while.
INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins
JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...
JAMES (over phone)
Why?
COBB
Well, James, like I've told you-I'm
away because I'm working...
LITTLE GIRL (over phone)
Grandma says you're never coming
back.
Cobb pauses. Takes a breath. INSERT CUT: James and Philippa,
FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to
someone's call− they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...
18.
COBB
Philippa, can you ask Grandma to
pick up the phone-
PHILIPPA (over phone)
She's shaking her head.
Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.
COBB
Well, we'll just have to hope
Grandma's wrong about that won't
we?
JAMES
(over phone)
Daddy?
COBB
Yes?
JAMES (over phone)
Is Mommy with you?
Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S
MEMORY− MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...
COBB
No. No, we talked about this,
James. Mommy's gone.
JAMES (over phone)
Where?
GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)
Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-
COBB
I'll give some presents to Grandpa,
okay? Just be good for-
Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK
at the door. Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the doorcracks
it: Arthur.
ARTHUR
Our ride's on the roof.
Cobb nods. Moves to pick up his bag. Arthur watches.
ARTHUR
Cobb... are you okay?
Cobb looks up.
19.
COBB
Yeah, why?
ARTHUR
Down in the dream... Mal showing up
like that ...
COBB
Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.
ARTHUR
It's getting worse, isn't it?
COBB
One apology's all you're getting,
Arthur. Now, where's Nash?
ARTHUR
Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?
COBB
(shakes head)
We were supposed to deliver Saito's
expansion plans to Cobol Engineering
two hours ago. By now they know we
failed. Time to disappear.
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.
ARTHUR
Where will you go?
COBB
Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.
Maybe sniff out a job when things
quiet down. You?
ARTHUR
Stateside.
COBB
(wistful) )
'Course. Send my regards.
Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic.
EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT
The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior. He freezes.
20.
INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS
Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against
the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.
SAITO
He sold you out. Thought to come to
me and bargain for his life...
Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.
SAITO
So I offer you the satisfaction.
COBB
That's not how I deal with things.
SAITO
Would you work with him again?
Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.
COBB
What will you do to him?
SAITO
Nothing. But I can't speak for your
friends from Cobol Engineering.
Saito looks out at the city slipping by.
COBB
What do you want from us?
SAITO
Inception.
Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.
SAITO
Is it possible?
ARTHUR
Of course not.
SAITO
If you can steal an idea from
someone's mind, why can't you plant
one there instead?
ARTHUR
Okay, here's planting an idea: I
say to you, "Don't think about
elephants."
21.
(MORE)
(Saito nods)
What are you thinking about?
SAITO
Elephants.
ARTHUR
Right. But it's not your idea
because you know I gave it to you.
SAITO
You could plant it subconsciously-
ARTHUR
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea. True
inspiration is impossible to fake.
COBB
No, it isn't.
SAITO
Can you do it?
COBB
I won't do it.
SAITO
In exchange, I'll give you the
information you were paid to steal.
COBB
Are you giving me a choice? Because
I can find my own way to square
things with Cobol.
SAITO
Then you do have a choice.
COBB
And I choose to leave.
EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER
The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.
INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
Saito indicates the plane.
SAITO
Tell the crew where you want to go,
they'll file the plan en route.
Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door.
22.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
SAITO
Mr. Cobb...? There is one other
thing I could offer you.
(Cobb stops)
How would you like to go home? To
America. To your children.
Cobb turns back to Saito.
COBB
You can't fix that. Nobody could.
SAITO
Just like inception.
Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.
ARTHUR
Cobb, come on-
COBB
How complex is the idea?
SAITO
Simple enough.
COBB
No idea's simple when you have to
plant it in someone else's mind.
SAITO
My main competitor is an old man in
poor health. His son will soon
inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire. Against his
own self-interest.
ARTHUR
Cobb, we should walk away from
this.
COBB
If I were to do it. If I could do
it... how do I know you can
deliver?
SAITO
You don't. But I can. So do you
want to take a leap of faith, or
become an old man, filled with
regret, waiting to die alone?
Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.
23.
SAITO
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And
choose your people more wisely.
INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER
Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry.
ARTHUR
I know how much you want to go home-
COBB
(sharp)
No, you don't.
ARTHUR
But this can't be done.
COBB
It can. You just have to go deep
enough.
ARTHUR
You don't know that!-
COBB
I've done it before.
Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.
ARTHUR
Did it work?
COBB
(quiet)
Yes.
ARTHUR
Who did you do it to?
Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.
ARTHUR
So why are we headed to Paris?
COBB
We're going to need a new
architect.
INT. GREAT HALL, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MORNING
Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.
24.
INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS
COBB (O.S.)
You never did like your office.
PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cobb.
MILES
No space to think in that broom
cupboard.
Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.
MILES
Is it safe for you to be here?
COBB
Extradition between France and the
U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.
MILES
I think they'd find a way to make
it work in your case.
Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.
COBB
Can you take these back for the
kids?
MILES
It'll take more than the occasional
stuffed animal to convince those
children they still have a father.
COBB
I know. I thought you could talk to
Marie about bringing them on
vacation. Somewhere I could meet-
MILES
Why would she listen to me?
COBB
You were married for twenty years.
MILES
She blames me as much as you.
COBB
Doesn't she understand that my kids
need me?
25.
MILES
Yes, she does. We all do. Go back
and face the music, Dom. Explain
what Mal did.
COBB
Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never
understand− they'd lock me up and
throwaway the key. Or worse.
MILES
You think what you're doing now is
helping your case?
COBB
Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
This is what I have. This is what
you taught me.
MILES
I never taught you to be a thief.
COBB
No, you taught me to navigate other
people's minds. But after what
happened with Mal there weren't a
whole lot of legitimate ways for me
to use that skill.
Miles looks at Cobb.
MILES
Why did you come here, Dom?
Cobb shifts slightly.
COBB
I found a way home. A job. For
powerful people. If I pull it off,
I can get back to my family. But I
need help.
Miles realizes something.
MILES
My God. You're here to corrupt one
of my brightest and best.
COBB
If you have someone good enough,
you have to let them decide for
themselves. You know what I'm
offering-
MILES
Money?
26.
COBB
No, not just money: the chance to
build cathedrals, entire citiesthings
that have never existed,
things that couldn't exist in the
real world...
MILES
Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects
are supposed to make those dreams
real.
COBB
That's not what you used to say.
You told me that in the real world
I'd be building attic conversions
and gas stations. You said that if
I mastered the dream-share I'd have
a whole new way of creating and
showing people my creations. You
told me it would free me.
Miles looks at Cobb, sad.
MILES
And I'm sorry. I was wrong.
COBB
No, you weren't. Your vision was a
vision of pure creativity. It's
where we took it that was wrong.
MILES
And now you want me to let someone
else follow you into fantasy.
COBB
They won't actually come on the
job, they'll just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers.
MILES
Design them yourself.
COBB
Mal won't let me.
Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled.
MILES
Come back to reality, Dom. Please.
COBB
You want to know what's real,
Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting
for their dad to come back.
27.
(MORE)
This job-this last job-is how I get
there.
Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.
COBB
I wouldn't be standing here if
there were any other way. I can get
home. But I need an architect who's
as good as I was.
Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides.
MILES
I've got someone better.
INT. CORRIDOR - LATER
Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.
MILES
Ariadne...
A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.
MILES
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.
ARIADNE
Pleased to meet you.
MILES
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb
has a job offer to discuss with
you.
ARIADNE
A work placement?
COBB
(smiles
Not exactly.
EXT. ROOFTOP, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER
Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH
PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.
COBB
A test.
28.
COBB (CONT'D)
ARIADNE
(mouth full)
Aren't you going to tell me
anything?
COBB
Before I describe the job, I have
to know you could do it.
ARIADNE
Why?
COBB
It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
Ariadne raises her eyebrows.
COBB
You have two minutes to draw a maze
that takes me one minute to solve.
Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.
COBB
Go.
She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.
COBB
Stop.
Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad,
then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is
taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.
COBB
Again.
She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...
COBB
Stop.
She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the
puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.
COBB
You'll have to-
She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.
Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.
Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.
29.
COBB
(working the maze)
More like it.
EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY
Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.
Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.
INT. SAME - LATER
Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He
erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...
EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY
Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.
COBB
They say we only use a fraction of
the true potential of our brains...
but they're talking about when
we're awake. While we dream, the
mind performs wonders.
ARIADNE
Such as?
COBB
How do you imagine a building? You
consciously create each aspect,
puzzling over it in stages... But
sometimes, when your imagination
flies-
ARIADNE
I'm discovering it.
COBB
Exactly. Genuine inspiration.
Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.
COBB
In a dream your mind continuously
does that...
Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
30.
COBB
It creates and perceives a world
simultaneously. So well that you
don't feel your brain doing the
creating. That's why we can shortcircuit
the process...
ARIADNE
How?
COBB
By taking over the creating part.
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.
COBB
This is where you come in. You
build the world of the dream. We
take the subject into that dream,
and let him £111 it with his
subconscious
ARIADNE
But are you trying to fool him that
the dream is actually real life?
COBB
(nods)
While we're in there, We don't want
him to realize he's dreaming.
ARIADNE
How could I ever get enough detail
to Convince him that it's real?
COBB
Our dreams reel real while we're in
them. It's only when we wake up we
realize things were strange,
Ariadne gestures around them-
ARIADNE
But all the textures of real lifethe
stone, the fabric. cars...
people... your mind can't create
all this.
COBB
It does. Every time you dream. Let
me ask you a question: You never
remember the beginning of your
dreams, do you? You just turn up in
the middle of what's going on.
31.
ARIADNE
I guess.
COBB
So... how did we end up at this
restaurant?
ARIADNE
We came here from...
Ariadne trails off, confused.
COBB
How did we get here? Where are we?
Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.
ARIADNE
Oh my God. We're dreaming.
Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.
COBB
Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
the workshop. This is your first
lesson in shared dreaming,
remember?
Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACESThe
restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his
head against the debris. She sees him-
ARIADNE
(shouting over noise)
If it's just a dream, why are you
covering your-
Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Ariadne JOLTS awake.
COBB (O.S.)
Because it's never just a dream.
Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the
lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.
32.
COBB
And a face full of glass hurts like
hell, doesn't it? While we're in
it, it's real.
ARTHUR
That's why the military developed
dream sharing-a training program
where soldiers could strangle, stab
and shoot each other, then wake up.
ARIADNE
How did architects get involved?
COBB
Someone had to design the dreams.
(to Arthur)
Let's go another five minutes-
ARIADNE
We were only asleep for five
minutes? We talked for an hour at
least...
COBB
When you dream, your mind functions
more quickly, so time seems to pass
more slowly.
ARTHUR
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.
COBB
Let's see how much trouble you can
cause in five minutes.
And we-
CUT TO:
EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY
Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.
COBB
It's good. You've got the cafe, the
layout... you forgot the book shop
but pretty much everything else is
here.
Ariadne looks at the passers-by.
ARIADNE
Who are the people?
33.
COBB
They’re projections of my
subconscious.
ARIADNE
Yours?
COBB
Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
subject. My subconscious populates
your world. That's one way we get
at a subject's thoughts-his mind
creates the people, so we can
literally talk to his subconscious.
ARIADNE
How else do you do it?
COBB
Architecture. Build a bank vault or
a jail, something secure, and the
subject's mind will fill it with
information he's trying to protect.
ARIADNE
Then you break in and steal it.
COBB
Exactly.
Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.
ARIADNE
I love the concrete sense of things-
(stamps foot)
Real weight, you know? I thought a
dream space would be all about the
visual, but it's the feel of
things. Question is, what happens
as you start to mess with
physics...
She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN
HALF− the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her
excitement.
ARIADNE
It's something, isn't it?
COBB
(quiet)
Yes. It is.
34.
As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the
projections STARING at her.
ARIADNE
Why are they looking at me?
COBB
Because you're changing things. My
subconscious feels that someone
else is creating the world. The
more you change things, the quicker
the projections converge on you.
ARIADNE
Converge?
COBB
They feel the foreign nature of the
dreamer, and attack-like white
blood cells fighting an infection.
ARIADNE
They're going to attack us?
COBB
Just you, actually.
They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.
COBB
It's beautiful... but if you keep
on changing things...
People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them
BUMP her shoulder as they pass.
ARIADNE
Mind telling your subconscious to
take it easy?
COBB
That’s why it’s called subconscious.
I don’t control it.
The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.
COBB
Arched stone, iron pillars...
it's...
35.
Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.
INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.
COBB
I know this bridge. This place is
real−
(serious)
You didn't imagine it, you
remembered it...
ARIADNE
(nods)
I cross it every day on my way to
the college.
COBB
Never recreate places from your
memory. Always imagine new places.
ARIADNE
You have to draw from what you know-
COBB
(tense)
Use pieces-a streetlamp,
phonebooths, a type of brick-not
whole areas.
Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...
ARIADNE
Why not?
COBB
Because building dreams out of your
own memories is the surest way to
lose your grip on what's real and
what's a dream.
ARIADNE
Did that happen to you?
Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.
COBB
Look, this isn't about me-
Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-
ARIADNE
Is that why you need me to build
your dreams?
36.
A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-
COBB
Leave her alone-
More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her
arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-
Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd
towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with
even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.
ARIADNE
Wake me up, Cobb.
As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFECOBB
Mal, no!
ARIADNE
Wake me up!
Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP-DAY
Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her-
ARTHUR
It's okay.
ARIADNE
Why couldn’t I wake?
ARTHUR
The only way to wake from inside
the dream is to die.
Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.
COBB
She'll need a totem.
ARIADNE
What?
ARTHUR
Some kind of personal icon. A small
object that you can always have
with you, and that no one else
knows,
Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He
heads to the bathroom.
37.
ARIADNE
That's some subconscious you've
got, Cobb.
(calls after him)
She's a real charmer!
ARTHUR
Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.
ARIADNE
(surprised)
She's his wife?
Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.
ARTHUR
So. A totem. You need something
small, potentially heavy...
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
marble counter...
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.
ARIADNE
Like a coin?
ARTHUR
Too common. You need something that
has a weight or movement that only
you know.
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more
and more ECCENTRIC...
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
ARIADNE
What’s yours?
Arthur holds out a DIE.
ARTHUR
A loaded die.
Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away-
38.
ARTHUR
I can’t let you handle it. That’s
the point. No one else can know the
weight or balance of it.
ARIADNE
Why?
ARTHUR
So when you examine your totem...
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Cobb’s spinning top WOBBLES OVER.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
You know, beyond a doubt, that
you’re not in someone else’s dream.
Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne thinks this over.
ARIADNE
That’s not an issue for me.
ARTHUR
Why not?
ARIADNE
Arthur, maybe you can’t see what’s
going on, maybe you don’t want to.
But Cobb’s got problems he’s tried
to bury down there. I’m not going
to open my mind to someone like
that.
Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.
COBB (O.S.)
She’ll be back.
Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.
COBB
I’ve never seen anyone pick it up
so fast. And one reality won’t be
enough for her now. When she comes
back, get her building mazes.
ARTHUR
Where will you be?
39.
COBB
I’ve got to talk to Eames.
ARTHUR
Eames? But he’s in Mombasa. Cobol’s
backyard.
COBB
Necessary risk.
ARTHUR
There are plenty of other thieves.
COBB
We don’t just need a thief. We need
a forger.
INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY
Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40’s), shabby
suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He
FIDDLES with his last two chips.
COBB (O.S.)
Rub them against each other all you
like, they’re not going to breed.
Eames looks up to see Cobb.
EAMES
You never know.
Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...
COBB
Drink?
Eames loses.
EAMES
You’re buying.
Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of
chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls
one off the top, squints at the embossed name.
COBB
You’re spelling hasn’t improved.
Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.
EAMES
Piss off.
COBB
How’s your handwriting?
40.
Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.
EAMES
Versatile.
INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS
Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.
EAMES
Word is, you’re not welcome in
these parts.
COBB
Yeah?
EAMES
There’s a price on your head from
Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one,
actually.
COBB
You wouldn’t sell me out.
Eames looks at Cobb, offended.
EAMES
‘Course I would.
COBB
(smiles)
Not when you hear what I’m selling.
EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.
COBB
Inception.
Eames’s glass stops halfway to his mouth.
COBB
Don’t bother telling me it’s
impossible.
EAMES
It’s perfectly possible. Just
bloody difficult.
COBB
That’s what I keep saying to
Arthur.
41.
EAMES
Arthur? You’re still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?
COBB
He’s a good point man.
EAMES
The best. But he has no
imagination. If you’re going to
perform inception, you need
imagination.
COBB
You’ve done it before?
EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the
idea in place, but it didn’t take.
COBB
You didn’t plant it deep enough?
EAMES
It’s not just about depth. You need
the simplest version of the ideathe
one that will grow naturally in
the subject’s mind. Subtle art.
COBB
That’s why I’m here.
EAMES
What’s the idea you need to plant?
COBB
We want the heir to a major
corporation to break up his
father’s empire.
EAMES
See, right there you’ve got various
political motivations, antimonopolistic
sentiment and so
forth. But all that stuff’s at the
mercy of the subject’s prejudiceyou
have to go to the basic.
COBB
Which is?
EAMES
The relationship with the father.
(downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
42.
Cobb shakes his head.
EAMES
There’s a man here. Yusuf. He
formulates his own versions of the
compounds.
COBB
Let’s go see him.
EAMES
Once you’ve lost your tail.
(Cobb reacts)
Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in
about two minutes after we did.
COBB
Cobol Engineering?
EAMES
They pretty much own Mombasa.
Cobb glances over the balcony.
COBB
Run interference. We’ll meet
downstairs in half an hour.
EAMES
Back here?
COBB
Last place they’d expect.
Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.
EAMES
Freddy!
The Businessman looks up, awkward.
EAMES
Freddy Simmonds, it is you!
Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.
EAMES
(looks harder)
Oh. No, it isn’t.
EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS
Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he
moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is
there.
43.
COBB
(disarming smile)
Yes?
SECOND BUSINESSMAN
We need to-
Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-
The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...
He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets
in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers
his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,
steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into
the alley outside...
Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
DRAWNCobb
sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow endhe
THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...
The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS
FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.
Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,
BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.
SAITO
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
COBB
(jumping in)
What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.
Saito?
SAITO
I have to protect my investment.
EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.
EAMES
This is your idea of losing a tail?
44.
COBB
(shrugs)
Different tail.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.
ARTHUR
He said you'd be back.
ARIADNE
I tried not to come.
ARTHUR
But there's nothing else quite like
it.
ARIADNE
No paper, no pens... nothing
between you and raw, direct
creation.
Arthur picks up his mechanism.
ARTHUR
Shall we take a look at paradoxical
architecture?
Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-
CUT TO:
INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER
Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.
ARTHUR
You're going to have to master a
few tricks if you're going to build
three complete dream levels.
A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...
ARIADNE
What sort of tricks?
They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.
ARTHUR
In a dream, you can cheat
architecture into impossible
shapes.
45.
(MORE)
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps. The
infinite staircase.
Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.
Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.
ARTHUR
See...
Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a
LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.
ARTHUR
Paradox. A closed loop like this
helps you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you've created.
ARIADNE
How big do the levels have to be?
ARTHUR
Anything from the floor of a
building, to an entire city. But it
has to be complicated enough for us
to hide from the projections.
ARIADNE
A maze.
ARTHUR
And the better the maze-
ARIADNE
The longer we have before the
projections catch us.
Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.
ARIADNE
My subconscious seems polite
enough.
ARTHUR
You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one
likes to see someone else messing
around in their mind.
ARIADNE
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
46.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
ARTHUR
I don't know if he can't, but he
won't. He thinks it's safer if he
doesn't know the layouts.
ARIADNE
Why?
ARTHUR
He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
I think she's getting stronger.
ARIADNE
His ex-wife?
ARTHUR
She's not his ex.
ARIADNE
They're still together?
Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle.
ARTHUR
No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What
you see in there is just his
projection of her.
ARIADNE
What was she like in real life?
ARTHUR
(quiet)
She was lovely.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY
Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As
Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.
SAITO
Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the
Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
He's spent his whole life being
groomed as successor-breaking up
his father's empire will take a
radical shift in his thinking.
COBB
What's your problem with Fischer?
SAITO
That's not your concern.
47.
COBB
This isn't the usual corporate
espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
inception. The seed of the idea we
plant will grow in this man's mind.
It'll change him. It might even
come to define him.
Saito looks at Cobb.
SAITO
My sources suggest you might not
have always been so cautious.
COBB
Then you need new sources, Mr.
Saito.
Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.
SAITO
Fischer Morrow has the regulators
in their pockets. We're the last
company standing between them and
total energy dominance and we can
no longer compete. Soon they'll
control the energy supply of half
the world. They'll be able to
blackmail governments, dictate
policy. In effect, they become a
new superpower. The world needs
Robert Fischer to change his mind.
EAMES
That's where we come in. How's
Robert Fischer's relationship to
his father?
SAITO
Rumor is the relationship is
complicated.
COBB
We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
Saito.
Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).
EAMES
Can you get me access to him?
Browning. Fischer senior's righthand
man. Fischer junior's
godfather.
48.
SAITO
It should be possible. If you can
get the right references.
EAMES
References are something of a
specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER
Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty,
wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-
INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS
Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty
glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a
portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning.
This is YUSUF.
YUSUF
Come, come.
Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.
YUSUF
Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so
very much about you.
(indicates chairs)
please.
Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.
YUSUF
Bloody cats.
Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass
bottles. None of them has a label.
YUSUF
You work using Somnacin, I think,
Mr. Cobb?
COBB
You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.
Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.
49.
COBB
(dubious)
Somnacin?
YUSUF
(proudly)
Yusuf's Somnacin.
Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.
COBB
As good as the real thing?
Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.
YUSUF
Better.
Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.
YUSUF
Binds the dreamers tight. Let's
them dream as one. Makes it real.
Of course, if you'd prefer, you
could use Somnacin brand. If you
could explain to the international
control council what you wanted it
for.
Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.
YUSUF
You are seeking a chemist?
(Cobb nods)
To formulate compounds for a job?
COBB
And to come into the held with us.
YUSUF
I rarely go into the held, Mr.
Cobb.
COBB
We need you there to tailor
compounds to our particular
requirements.
YUSUF
Which are?
COBB
Great depth.
YUSUF
A dream within a dream? Two levels?
50.
COBB
Three.
YUSUF
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams would be too
unstable.
COBB
I've done it before. You just have
to add a sedative.
YUSUF
A powerful sedative. How many team
members?
COBB
Five.
SAITO
Six.
(to Cobb)
The only way to know you've done
the job is if I go in with you.
COBB
There's no room for tourists on
these jobs, Mr. Saito.
SAITO
This time, it would seem there is.
Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.
YUSUF
Of course. I use it every day.
Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid
inside.
COBB
For what?
Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL
DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.
YUSUF
Perhaps... you will not want to
see.
Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.
51.
INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS
A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping
occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN
watches over them.
EAMES
(counting)
Eighteen, twenty-all connected,
bloody hell.
YUSUF
They come every day. To share the
dream.
Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest
bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP.
The sleeper does not even stir.
YUSUF
See? Very stable.
COBB
How long do they dream?
YUSUF
Three, four hours. Every day.
COBB
How long in dream time?
YUSUF
With this compound... about forty
hours. Each and every day.
Saito surveys the room, appalled.
SAITO
Why do they do it?
YUSUF
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
COBB
After a while...
(looks at Saito)
It becomes the only way you can
dream.
YUSUF
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.
EAMES
They come here every day to sleep?
52.
ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)
No.
Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his
dreamers.
ELDERLY BALD MAN
They come to be woken up... the
dream has become their reality...
The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.
ELDERLY BALD MAN
And who are you to say otherwise?
Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to
Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.
COBB
Let's see what you can do.
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him.
As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a
FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed
to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is
BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY
Cobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him.
YUSUF
Sharp, no?
Cobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around-
INT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS
Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT:
A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He
tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it
FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is
there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.
53.
SAITO
Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?
Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top.
COBB
Everything's fine.
INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT
Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over.
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests
the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there,
unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.
ARIADNE
You're back.
Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out.
ARIADNE
Are you going under on your own?
COBB
I just-I need to test some things.
I didn't realize anyone was here.
ARIADNE
Just working on my totem.
Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it.
COBB
Let me see-
Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods.
COBB
You're learning.
ARIADNE
It's an elegant solution to keeping
track of reality. Your invention?
COBB
No. Mal's.
Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it.
54.
COBB
This one was hers. She'd spin it in
a dream and it would never topple.
Just spin and spin...
ARIADNE
Arthur told me she died.
COBB
She did. How are the mazes coming?
Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.
ARIADNE
Good. Each level relates to the
part of the subject's subconscious
we're trying to access. I'm making
the bottom level a hospital, so
that Fischer will bring his father
there-
COBB
Don't tell me. Remember, you only
want the dreamer to know the
layout.
ARIADNE
Why's that so important?
COBB
In case one of us brings in part of
our subconscious. You wouldn't want
any projections knowing the layout.
ARIADNE
In case you bring Mal in.
Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE
You won't build yourself because if
you know the maze, then she knows
it. And she'd sabotage the
operation. You can't keep her out,
can you?
Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE
Do the others know?
COBB
No.
55.
ARIADNE
You have to warn them if it's
getting worse-
COBB
(gentle)
I didn't say it's getting worse.
Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
job. I need you for this job.
Without your help, I'll never get
back to my children. And that's all
I can care about right now.
ARIADNE
Why can't you go home, Cobb?
Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.
COBB
They think I killed her.
ARIADNE
How did she die?
Cobb thinks.
INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now
we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGINGCOBB
Thank you.
ARIADNE
For what?
COBB
Not asking whether I did.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,
looking at FILES. Cobb presides.
COBB
The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
the Australian energy conglomerate,
Fischer Morrow.
Cobb opens a large presentation pad.
COBB (reads aloud)
"I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S
EMPIRE."
Cobb turns to the team.
56.
COBB
An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
mind would never accept. We have to
plant it deep in his subconscious.
ARTHUR
How deep?
COBB
Three levels down.
ARTHUR
A dream within a dream within a
dream? Is that even possible?
COBB
Yes. It is.
COBB
Now, the subconscious motivates
through emotion, not reason, so we
have to translate the idea into an
emotional concept.
ARTHUR
How do you translate a business
strategy into an emotion?
COBB
That's what we have to figure out.
Robert and his father have a tense
relationship. Worse, even, than the
gossip columns have suggested...
EAMES
Do you play on that? Suggest
breaking up his father's company as
a 'screw you' to the old man?
COBB
No. Positive emotion trumps
negative emotion every time. We
yearn for people to be reconciled,
for catharsis. We need positive
emotional logic.
Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.
EAMES
Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."
COBB
That might work.
57.
ARTHUR
Might? We'll have to do better than
that.
EAMES
Thanks for the contribution,
Arthur.
ARTHUR
Forgive me for wanting a little
specificity, Eames.
COBB
Inception's not about specificity.
When we get inside his head, we're
going to have to work with what we
find.
Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And we-
CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY
The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.
EAMES
We could split the idea into
emotional triggers, and use one on
each level.
COBB
How do you mean?
EAMES
On the top level, we open up his
relationship with his father....
Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
down we've accessed his ambition
and self-esteem. We feed him: "I
WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
Then, the bottom level, we bring
out the emotional big guns...
COBB
"MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
HIM."
EAMES
That could do it.
ARTHUR
How do you produce these emotional
triggers?
58.
EAMES
I forge each emotional concept in
the style and manner of Peter
Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
emotional life.
Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.
ARTHUR
Are those yours?
Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.
ARTHUR
Yusuf?
YUSUF
Yup. Sorry.
COBB
Suppress them. We don't bring our
own projections into the dream-we
let Fischer's subconscious supply
the people.
EAMES
Saito, when do I get to see
Browning?
SAITO
You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
We've arranged for you to spend
several days...
INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY
Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled
high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors.
SAITO (V.O.)
...as part of a consulting
litigation team working for
Browning.
BROWNING
I'm not smelling settlement here-we
take them down.
LAWYER
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
policy is always one of avoiding
litigation-
Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL.
59.
BROWNING
Shall we relay your concerns
directly to Maurice?
Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office.
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into-
INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk
should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT
FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted.
BROWNING
How is he?
Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at
his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.
BROWNING
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily but I know he-
FATHER
Robert! I've told you to keep out
the damn!-
MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A
NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED
PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a
YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of
the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.
BROWNING
Must be a cherished memory of his-
FISCHER
I put it by his bed. He hasn't even
noticed.
BROWNING
Robert, we have to talk about a
power of attorney. I know this is
hard for you, but it's important
that we start to think about the
future-
FISCHER
Not now, Uncle Peter.
Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.
EAMES (V.O.)
The vultures are circling. The
sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the
stronger Peter Browning becomes...
60.
Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move .
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...
EAMES (V.O.)
I've had time to learn Browning's
physical presence and mannerisms...
In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK.
INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
EAMES
Now, in the dream, I can impersonate
Browning and suggest the concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind...
(draws a diagram)
Then we take Fischer down another
level and his own subconscious
feeds it right back to him.
ARTHUR
(impressed)
So he gives himself the idea.
EAMES
Precisely. That's the only way
to make it stick. It has to seem
self-generated.
ARTHUR
Eames, I'm impressed.
EAMES
Your condescension, as always, is
much appreciated, Arthur.
CUT TO:
INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby,
debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.
EAMES
He's not scheduled for surgery, no
dental, nothing.
COBB
I thought he had some knee thing?
EAMES
Nothing they'd put him under for.
Besides, we need a good ten hours.
61.
SAITO
Sydney to Los Angeles.
They turn to Saito.
SAITO
Twelve hours and forty-five
minutes-one of the longest flights
in the world. He makes it every two
weeks...
EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the
tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.
COBB (V.O.)
Surely he flies private?
SAITO (V.O.)
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.
Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over.
ARTHUR
It'd have to be a 747.
COBB
Why?
ARTHUR
On a 747 the pilots are up above,
first class is in the nose so
nobody walks through the cabin.
We'd have to buyout the whole
cabin, and the first class flight
attendant-
SAITO
We bought the airline.
Everyone turns to Saito.
SAITO
It seemed... neater.
COBB
Neater, huh?
(gets to his feet)
Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
hours.
62.
(MORE)
(to Ariadne)
Nice lobby, by the way.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.
ARTHUR
My question is how we go down three
layers with enough stability. Three
layers down a little turbulence is
gonna translate into an earthquake.
The dreams are gonna collapse with
the slightest disturbance.
Yusuf clears his throat.
YUSUF
Sedation. For sleep stable enough to
create three layers of dreaming...
INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.
YUSUF (V.O.)
We will have to combine it with an
extremely powerful sedative....
Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.
YUSUF
The compound we'll be using to
share the dream is an advanced
Somnacin derivative. It creates a
very clear connection between
dreamers, whilst actually
accelerating brain function.
CUT TO:
COBB
Buying us more time in each level.
YUSUF
Brain function in the dream will be
about twenty times normal.
63.
COBB (CONT'D)
(MORE)
And when you go into a dream within
that dream the effect is
compounded.
ARIADNE
How much time?
YUSUF
Three dreams... that's ten hours,
times twenty, times twenty, times
twenty...
EAMES
Math was never my strong suit.
COBB
It's basically a week one layer
down, six months two layers down-
ARIADNE
And ten years in the third level.
Who wants to spend ten years in a
dream?
YUSUF
Depends on the dream.
EAMES
It's not going to take us long to
crack Fischer open once we get
going. We'll be out in a couple
days, max.
ARTHUR
How do we get out once we've made
the plant?
(to Cobb)
I hope you've got something a
little more elegant in mind than
shooting me in the head like last
time.
Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb.
COBB
A kick.
ARIADNE
What's a kick?
Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS it-
Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-
EAMES
That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
64.
YUSUF (CONT'D)
COBB
That feeling of falling which snaps
you awake. We use that to jolt
ourselves awake once we're done.
ARTHUR
But how are we going to feel that
through the sedation?
YUSUF
That's the clever part. I customize
the sedative...
INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.
YUSUF (O.S.)
To leave inner ear function
unimpaired...
Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair
backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING
just before he HITS the floor.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.
YUSUF
That way, however deep the sleep, the
sleeper will still feel falling...
INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side ...
YUSUF (V.O.)
Or tipping...
Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKEINT.
WORKSHOP - DAY
Arthur thinks this through.
ARTHUR
Even that won't cut through three
layers of deep sleep.
COBB
The trick is to devise a kick for
each level, then synchronize them
to get a snap that penetrates all
three layers.
65.
Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.
ARTHUR
We can use the musical countdown to
synchronize the different kicks.
INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT
Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is lying on
one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechanism.
Ariadne stands over him. Watching.
She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, checking
the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY
Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots the "B." The
elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill at-
INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY
Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room,
considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is a doll's
house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Inside is a
SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES her- she turns,
looking through a doorway into another room...
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking,
arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying
to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation-
MAL
You remember when you asked me to
marry you?
COBB
Of course...
MAL
You said you had a dream...
COBB
That we'd grow old together.
MAL
And we can. You know how to find
me... you know what you have to do.
Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyesgentle,
loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.
66.
FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves
towards her, leaving Mal.
COBB
You shouldn't be in here.
Cobb guides her back into the elevator.
ARIADNE
I wanted to know what "tests" you
need to do on your own every night.
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY
Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator
RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching
off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the
sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from
us, building a SANDCASTLE.
ARIADNE
Why do you do this to yourself?
COBB
This is the only way I can still
dream.
ARIADNE
Is it so important to dream?
Cobb stares at his family.
COBB
In my dreams... we're still together.
The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY.
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
The elevator descends.
ARIADNE
But these aren't just dreams, are
they? They're memories. You said
never to use memories.
COBB
And I shouldn't.
ARIADNE
You're keeping her alive.
COBB
No.
67.
ARIADNE
You can't let her go.
COBB
No. These are moments I regret.
Moments I turned into dreams so I
could change them.
Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."
ARIADNE
What've you got buried down there
that you regret?
Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button.
COBB
There's only one thing I need you
to understand about me...
INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there,
standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.
ARIADNE
This is your house?
COBB
Mine and Mal's.
ARIADNE
Where is she?
COBB
She'd already died.
The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUTCobb
TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to
look at something on the ground.
COBB
It's James. My boy. He's found
something. Maybe a worm.
A slightly older girl RUNS into view.
COBB
And there's Philippa.
She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.
68.
COBB
I thought about calling out, so
they'd turn and smile those
incredible smiles... but I'm out of
time-
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.
THIN MAN
Right now. Or never, Cobb.
Cobb nods, turns from the window-
COBB
Then I panic that I'll always wish
I'd seen them turn, that I can't
waste this chance...
Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...
COBB
But the moment's passed. And
whatever I do, the dream's always
the same... When I'm about to
call... they run.
Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.
COBB
If I'm going to see their faces
again-I've got to get back here in
the real world...
Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS.
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to
DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors
slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of
freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps
cautiously out into-
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)
DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table,
STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps
forwards- SMASH− she looks down to see that she has kicked
over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN
BILLOWS.
MAL (O.S.)
What are you doing here?
Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there.
69.
ARIADNE
My name is-
MAL
I know who you are. What are you
doing here?
ARIADNE
I don't know. Trying to understand.
MAL
How could you understand? Do you
know what it is to be a lover? To
be half of a whole?
ARIADNE
No.
Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...
MAL
I'll tell you a riddle. You're
waiting for a train. A train that
will take you far away. You know
where you hope this train will take
you, but you don't know for sure...
Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.
MAL
But... it doesn't matter. How can
it not matter to you where that
train will take you?
COBB (O.S.)
Because you'll be together.
Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks at him.
MAL
How could you bring her here, Dom?
ARIADNE
What is this place?
COBB
A hotel. We spent our anniversaries
in this suite.
ARIADNE
What happened here?
Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...
70.
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself
towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against it
AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHESMAL
you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE
TOGETHER!-
COBB
We can. We will. But I need you to
stay here for now-
MAL
YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-
Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.
COBB
I'll come back. I need you to stay
here on your own for now. Just
while I do this job. Then we can be
together-
MAL
WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-
Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. we-
CUT TO:
INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT
Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker
open. He sees her watching him.
ARIADNE
You think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?
You think that's going to contain
her?
The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.
SAITO
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
COBB
When's the funeral?
SAITO
Thursday. In Los Angeles.
71.
COBB
Robert'll accompany the body
Tuesday at the outside. We have to
move.
Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.
ARIADNE
(low)
I'm coming with you.
COBB
No. I promised Miles.
ARIADNE
The team needs someone in there who
understands what you're struggling
with. If you don't want it to be me
then you need to show Arthur what I
just saw.
Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.
COBB
We need one more seat on the plane.
INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY
Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives
beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.
COBB
If I get on this plane and you
haven't taken care of things...
when we land I go to jail for the
rest of my life.
SAITO
Complete the job en route, I make
one phone call from the plane...
you will have no trouble clearing
immigration.
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS
The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees
Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each
other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames
enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the
passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,
bag in hand, wearing black.
EAMES
Oh, sorry.
72.
Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.
EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The 747 HURTLES down the runway.
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center
of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark.
Cobb unbuckles, stands.
COBB
Excuse me?
Fischer looks up.
FISCHER
Yes?
COBB
I think this is yours...
Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to
Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands
Fischer the passport.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Would you gentlemen care for a
drink?
FISCHER
Water.
COBB
Same.
Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.
FISCHER
Well, thank you.
COBB
No problem. Look, I couldn't help
noticing your name. You're not
related to Maurice Fischer?
Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.
FISCHER
Actually, he was my father.
73.
COBB
I'm very sorry for your loss. He
was an inspiring figure.
The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.
COBB
Thanks.
As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.
COBB
To Maurice Fischer.
(they drink)
I'll leave you in peace.
Fischer grants him a smile.
EXT. 747 - LATER
The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall
onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb
SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.
Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed
them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur
rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's
wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.
Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on
Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.
The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes
the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. SEDAN - DAY
Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS
down. Cobb pulls over-
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS
Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar
turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.
74.
INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.
ARTHUR
(indicates rain)
Couldn't you have peed before you
went under?
YUSUF
Sorry.
The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.
EAMES
Bit too much free champagne before
takeoff, Yusuf?
YUSUF
Ha bloody ha.
COBB
At least we know he'll be looking
for a cab in this.
INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.
COBB
Brace yourselves.
Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-
CABDRIVER
Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
driving without your thumb up-
He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.
COBB
Walk away.
The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both
cars pull away.
INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS
Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.
75.
FISCHER
Third and Market. Snappy.
Eames JUMPS in from the other side.
FISCHER
What're you doing?
EAMES
Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe
we could share.
FISCHER
Maybe not.
Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.
FISCHER
Great.
Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it
at Eames.
FISCHER
(contemptuous)
There's 500 dollars in there. And
the wallet's worth more than that.
For that you ought to at least drop
me at my stop.
Eames smiles at this.
EAMES
I'm afraid-
A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT
IMPACTS by Saito-
EAMES
Get us out of here!
Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in
front, BLOCKING the path-
A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the
front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRECOBB
Come on!-
Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan
ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT
OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS
PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
76.
A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN
advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.
Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of
Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-
Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-
ARIADNE
This wasn't in the design-
Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the
train-
A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an
AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,
raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREENCobb
clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-
Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HANDYANKS
the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security
Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-
Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAPArthur
YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through
the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a
ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the
other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHESARTHUR
Everybody okay? Saito?
Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered
in BLOOD.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps
out− PULLS the shutter down behind them-
INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him
through a doorway. Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.
COBB
Arthur! Arthur what the-
Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.
COBB
Oh, Christ. Is he dying?
77.
ARTHUR
I don't know. What happened back
there? Where were you?
COBB
We were blocked by a freight train.
ARTHUR
(to Ariadne)
Why would you put a train crossing
in a downtown intersection?
ARIADNE
I didn't.
COBB
(snaps)
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?!
Those weren't regular projectionsthey'd
been trained!
ARIADNE
How could they be trained?
ARTHUR
Fischer's had an extractor teach
his mind to defend itself. His
subconscious is militarized. It
should've shown on the research-
COBB
So why the hell didn't it?!
ARTHUR
Calm down.
COBB
Don't tell me to calm down-you were
meant to check Fischer's background
thoroughly. You can't make this
kind of mistake-we're not prepared
for this kind of violence-
ARTHUR
Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security
before. We just have to be more-
COBB
This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!
(points at Saito)
He's dying!
EAMES
So we put him out of his misery.
78.
Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over
Saito.
COBB
No.
EAMES
He's in agony. Let's wake him up-
Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.
COBB
No!
(they lock eyes)
It won't wake him up.
EAMES
What do you mean, it won't wake
him? When you die in a dream you
wake up.
YUSUF
Not from this. We're too heavily
sedated to wake up that way.
Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.
EAMES
So what happens if one of us dies?
COBB
That person doesn't wake up. Their
mind drops into Limbo.
ARIADNE
Limbo?
ARTHUR
Unconstructed dream space.
ARIADNE
What's down there?
ARTHUR
Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing
there but what was left behind by
anyone on the team who's been trapped
there before. On this team... just
Cobb.
ARIADNE
How long would we be stuck there?
79.
YUSUF
You couldn't even think about
trying to escape until the sedation
eases-
EAMES
How long?
YUSUF
Decades-it could be infinite-I
don't know! Ask him-he's the one
who's been there before!
Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.
EAMES
Great. So now we're stuck in
Fischer's mind battling it out with
his private army, and if we get hit
we're stuck in Limbo 'til our
brains dissolve into scrambled egg?
Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.
ARTHUR
Let's just get him upstairs.
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines him. He
motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb.
ARTHUR
Hold this. Firm pressure.
Arthur turns to Cobb.
ARTHUR
You knew the risks and you didn't
tell us.
COBB
There wasn't meant to be any risk.
We weren't supposed to be dealing
with a load of gunnre.
ARTHUR
You had no right.
COBB
It's the only way you can go three
layers deep, Arthur.
Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.
80.
ARTHUR
And you. You went along with this?
YUSUF
I trusted him.
ARTHUR
You trusted him? When? When he
promised you half his share?
YUSUF
(offended)
No! His whole share. Plus, he told
me he'd done it before.
Arthur turns to Cobb.
ARTHUR
Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out
great, didn't it, Cobb?
Cobb grabs Arthur.
COBB
You don't know anything about that.
This was the only way to do this
job, Arthur. I did what I had to do
to get back to my children.
EAMES
So you led us into a war zone with
no way out.
COBB
We have a way out. The kick. We
just have to push on, do the job as
fast as possible and get out using
the kick.
EAMES
Forget it. We go any deeper, we
just raise the stakes. I'm sitting
it out on this level.
COBB
You'll never make it, Eames.
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak. The ten
hours of the flight is a week at
this level−you'll never make it
without getting killed. Downwards
is the only way forwards. We have
to carry on.
Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-
81.
COBB
And we have to do it fast.
Eames and Arthur weigh this.
COBB
Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's
get in there and soften him up.
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER
Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from
Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator.
FISCHER
I'm insured against kidnapping up
to ten million-this'll be simple-
COBB
No, it won't.
Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.
ARTHUR
In. your lather's office, below the
bookshelves, is his personal safe.
We need the combination.
FISCHER
I never noticed a safe-
COBB
Doesn't mean you don't know the
combination.
FISCHER
Well, I don't.
ARTHUR
We have it on good authority that
you do.
FISCHER
Whose?
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a
HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.
YUSUF
Five hundred dollars, this cost?
EAMES
What's inside?
82.
YUSUF
Cash, cards, ID... and this-
Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's
office− YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER
blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb
enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.
EAMES
Useful?
Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.
COBB
You're on. You've got an hour.
EAMES
An hour? I was supposed to have all
night to crack him.
COBB
And Saito was supposed to keep his
guts on the inside. You've got an
hour-get something we can use.
Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his
watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-
FISCHER
What's that?
ARTHUR
Good authority.
Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice.
FISCHER
Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-
ARTHUR
The combination.
FISCHER
I don't know it!
ARTHUR
Why would Browning tell us you did?
FISCHER
Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
83.
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the
room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs
Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.
COBB
You've got an hour. Get talking.
Cobb leaves.
BROWNING (EAMES)
They've had me for two days.
They've got someone with access to
your father's office and they're
trying to open his safe-they
thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't-
FISCHER
Neither do I, Uncle Peter.
BROWNING
(confused)
Maurice told me that after he
passed only you would be able to
open it.
FISCHER
He never gave me the combination.
Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something.
BROWNING
He did, he just didn't tell you
that it was a combination.
FISCHER
What, then?
BROWNING
Something only you would know. Some
meaningful combination of numbers
from your experiences with Maurice-
FISCHER
We didn't have a lot of meaningful
experiences together.
BROWNING
Perhaps after your mother died...
FISCHER
After my mother died, I went to him
in my grief.
84.
(MORE)
You know what he told me? "There's
really nothing to be said, Robert."
BROWNING
He always had a hard time with
emotional-
FISCHER
I was eleven, Uncle Peter.
Browning (Eames) takes this in.
BROWNING
He loved you, Robert. In his way.
FISCHER
"In his way?" At the end he called
me to his deathbed. He could barely
speak, but he took the trouble to
say one last thing to me. He pulled
me close... I could make out only
one word. "Disappointed."
Browning can say nothing.
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is
breathing fast, shallow.
COBB
How's he doing?
ARIADNE
He's in a lot of pain.
Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye.
COBB
When we get you down to the next
level, the pain will be less
intense.
Saito nods, breathing hard.
ARIADNE
(low)
And if he dies?
COBB
His conscious mind will drop out of
the dream. He'll be trapped in
Limbo for a lifetime...
ARIADNE
What will that do to him?
85.
FISCHER (CONT'D)
Cobb looks at her. Grave.
COBB
When he wakes... his mind could be
completely gone.
SAITO
When... when we wake I will still
honor our arrangement...
Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.
COBB
Saito-san, when you wake you might
not even remember that we had an
arrangement. You'll have forgotten
this world. Limbo will be your
reality. Lost there so long, you'll
have become an old man...
SAITO
Filled with regret?
COBB
Waiting to die alone. Yes.
SAITO
Then I'll take the chance and come
back. And we'll be young men
together again.
Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.
ARIADNE
When were you trapped in Limbo?
Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.
ARIADNE
Cobb, you might have convinced the
rest of this team to carry on with
the job. But they don't know the
truth.
COBB
What truth?
ARIADNE
The truth that at any minute you
might bring a freight train through
the wall. The truth that Mal is
bursting up through your
subconscious.
86.
(MORE)
The truth that as we go deeper into
Fischer, we're also going deeper
into you-and I'm not sure we're
going to like what we find there.
Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing.
ARIADNE
This is not just about Fischer,
it's about you. Tell me what
happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
Limbo.
Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through.
COBB
We were on a job. Exploring dreams
within dreams. But we didn't
understand how your mind can turn
hours into years. How you can get
trapped. Trapped so deep that when
you wash up on the shore of your
subconscious...
INSERT CUT: MAL LIES ON THE SAND, STARING UP AT A CLOUDLESS
SKY, WAVES WASHING OVER HER...
COBB
You can lose track of what's real.
ARIADNE
How long were you stuck?
Cobb pauses before he answers. Looks at Ariadne.
COBB
Fifty years.
Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.
ARIADNE
How did you stand it?
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL BUILD A SANDCASTLE ON THE BEACH...
COBB
We built. We created a whole world
for ourselves...
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL WALK THROUGH A DESERTED CITY.
COBB
It's not so bad at first, being
gods. The problem is knowing that
it's not real. It became impossible
for me to live like that.
87.
ARIADNE (CONT'D)
ARIADNE
But not for her?
COBB
She accepted it. At some point...
INSERT CUT:
INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY
Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE. Inside is a SAFE. She opens it- it
is empty. She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.
COBB (V.O.)
...she'd decided to forget that our
world wasn't real.
Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
ARIADNE
And when you finally woke up?
COBB
To wake from that. From decades
lived. To be old souls thrown back
into youth. It was hard. At first
Mal seemed okay. But I started to
realize something was wrong.
Finally she admitted it. This idea
she was possessed by. This simple
little idea that changed
everything...
ARIADNE
What was it?
COBB
That our world was not real. No
matter what I did, no matter what I
said, she was convinced that we
were still in a dream. That we
needed to wake up again...
INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.
COBB (V.O.)
That to get home we'd have to kill
ourselves.
INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.
88.
ARIADNE
What about your children?
Cobb has to look away.
COBB
She... she believed they weren't
real. That our real children were
waiting. Somewhere above...
INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of
the room, FACES UNSEENCOBB
Calm down, Mal-
MAL
They're projections, Dom. Your
dreams. I'm their mother-don't you
think I can tell the difference?
Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter
tears.
COBB
If it's my dream then why can't I
control it? Why can't I stop this?
MAL
(it's obvious)
You don't know you're dreaming.
COBB
You keep telling me I am-
MAL
And you don't believe me!
COBB (V.O.)
She was certain. But she loved me
too much to go without me. So she
made a plan...
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.
COBB (V.O.)
For our anniversary...
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED
BEDCLOTHES.
89.
He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne
glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE
FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken
glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it,
thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The
CURTAIN BILLOWS.
EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the
opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the
dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.
MAL
Join me.
COBB
Mal, come back inside.
MAL
No. I'm going to jump. And you're
coming with me.
COBB
No, I'm not. This is real-if you
jump, you're not going to wake up,
you're going to die. Let's go back
inside and talk about this, please.
MAL
We've talked enough.
She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.
MAL
Come out onto the ledge or I'll
jump right now.
She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge
opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.
MAL
I'm asking you to take a leap of
faith.
COBB
I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave
our children.
MAL
If I go without you, they'll take
them away, anyway.
COBB
What do you mean?
90.
MAL
I filed a letter with our attorney.
Explaining how I'm fearful for my
safety, how you've threatened to
kill me...
Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...
MAL (CONT’D)
I love you, Dom. I’ve freed you
from the guilt of choosing to leave
them. We’re going home to our real
children.
COBB
Out children are here, Mal.
Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...
MAL
You’re waiting for a train...
COBB
NO! MAL, NO, I CAN’T!
MAL
A train that will take you far
away...
COBB
DON’T DO THIS!
MAL
You know where you hope this train
will take you, you can’t know for
sure...
COBB
DON’T!
MAL
But it doesn’t matter...
COBB
NO!
MAL
Because you’ll be together...
Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then
tries to bury his face in the wall...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY
Cobb stares as he remembers.
91.
COBB
He letter to the authorities
refuted all the claims about her
sanity that she knew I’d make...
INT. COBB AND MAL’S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.
COBB (V.O.)
She’d had herself declared sane by
three different psychiatrists.
Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES,
Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...
COBB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It was impossible for me to explain
the nature of her madness...
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb’s hand.
THIN MAN
Right now. Or never, Cobb.
Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and
Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the
paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.
COBB (V.O.)
So I ran. And I’ve been running
ever since, trying to buy my way
back to my family...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY
Cobb looks across at Ariadne.
ARIADNE
Psychiatrists judged her sane?
COBB
She was sane. She was just lost in
the labyrinth.
ARIADNE
Then why should you blame yourself?
COBB
Because we were a family. And we
had a life I would do anything to
get back to now. But that reality
wasn’t enough for me then.
92.
ARIADNE
It might have been your idea to
push the limits, Cobb. But you’re
not responsible for the idea that
destroyed her. The idea that her
world wasn’t real... that was her
own idea from her own mind.
Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE (CONT’D)
Your guilt defines her. Powers her.
If we’re going to succeed in this,
you’re going to have to forgive
yourself, and you’re going to have
to confront her. But you don’t have
to do it alone.
COBB
You don’t have to do this for me-
ARIADNE
I’m doing it for the others. They
don’t know the risk they’ve taken
coming in here with you.
Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a
position. Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.
COBB
We can’t stay here. Arthur?!
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Browning puts his hand on Fischer’s shoulder.
BROWNING
These people are going to kill us
if we don’t give them the
combination.
FISCHER
They won’t, they’ll try to ransom
us-
BROWNING
I heard them-they’re going to lock
us in and run the can into the
river.
FISCHER
What is in the safe?
93.
BROWNING
Something for you. Maurice always
said it was his most previous
gift... a will.
FISCHER
Maurice’s will is with Port and
Dunn.
BROWNING
It’s an alternate. It supersedes
the other only if you want it to.
FISCHER
What does it say?
BROWNING
It splits all the component
businesses of Fischer Morrow into
individual companies, transferring
ownership to the boards of those
companies...
FISCHER
Leaving me nothing?
BROWNING
A basic living. Nothing more. The
entire empire would cease to exist.
FISCHER
Destroy my own inheritance? Why
would he suggest such a thing?
BROWNING
I don’t know, Robert.
Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him.
COBB
Come to your senses?
FISCHER
Let us go. I don’t know the
combination. Not consciously.
Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his gun.
COBB
Let’s try instinctively. I have
someone standing in your father’s
office ready to tap in a
combination.
He holds the phone to Fischer’s mouth.
94.
COBB (CONT’D)
First six numbers that come into
your head. Right now.
FISCHER
I have no idea-
Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-
COBB
RIGHT NOW!
FISCHER
Five, two, eight... four, nine,
one.
Cobb lowers his weapon. Listens to the phone. Shakes his
head. Shuts the phone.
COBB
You’ll have to do better. Bag ‘em.
Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.
INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-
FISCHER
We’re worth much more to you
alive...
Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to
drop LIQUID onto Fischer’s mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARDS.
“Browning” yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.
EAMES
(excited)
His relationship with his father’s
much worse that we thought.
ARTHUR
That helps us?
Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.
COBB
The stronger the issues, the more
powerful the catharsis.
Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.
ARTHUR
But how do you reconcile them if
they’re that estranged?
95.
EAMES
I’m working on that.
Arthur lines up a shot through the window-
ARTHUR
Well, work fast-Fischer’s
projections are closing in quick,
we need to break out of here before
we’re totally boxed in...
Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito
into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his
bandages. Arthur can’t get the last sniper- he’s too hidden
behind a wall-
EAMES
Shouldn’t be afraid to dream a
little bigger, Arthur-
Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the
sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.
EAMES (CONT’D)
Shall we?
They climb into the van-
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - CONTINUOUS
The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur
opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-
COBB
Shifting Fischer’s antipathy from
his father onto Browning should
work.
EAMES
We need the imagery, the words...
ARIADNE
So you destroy his one positive
relationship?
COBB
No. We repair his relationship with
his father and expose his
godfather’s true nature.
EAMES
Hell, we should be charging Fischer
as much as Saito.
96.
ARTHUR
What about his security? It’s going
to get worse as we go deeper.
COBB
We bring in Mr. Charles.
ARTHUR
No.
EAMES
Who’s Mr. Charles?
ARTHUR
A bad idea.
COBB
Arthur, the second we approach
Fischer in that hotel, they’re
gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.
Charles like on the Stein job.
EAMES
So you’ve done it before?
ARTHUR
Sure. But it didn’t work. The
subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to
pieces.
Eames takes this in.
EAMES
You learned a lot, though. Right?
COBB
(to Eames)
I’ll need a decoy.
EAMES
No problem. How about a pretty
young lady I’ve used before?
COBB
Fine-
Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.
COBB (CONT’D)
(to Yusuf)
I know you’ve got to stay ahead of
them, but drive with kid gloves,
okay? The world down there is going
to be very unstable-
97.
ARTHUR
And don’t make the jump too soonthat
kick is our only way back, we
have to be ready to catch it-
YUSUF
I’ll use the music to let you know
when it’s coming, but the rest is
up to you.
Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.
YUSUF (CONT’D)
Everyone ready?
Nods all round.
YUSUF (CONT’D)
Sweet dreams-
Yusuf hits a button and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET
Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking.
BLONDE (O.S.)
Am I boring you?
Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.
BLONDE (CONT’D)
I was telling you my story. I guess
it wasn’t to your liking.
FISCHER
I have a lot on my mind.
Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING
CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot
Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.
ARTHUR
And there goes Mr. Charles.
ARIADNE
Who or what, exactly, is Mr.
Charles?
98.
ARTHUR
It’s a gambit designed to turn
Fischer against his own
subconscious.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer’s Subsecurity.
COBB
Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again.
Rod Green, Marketing.
(to Blonde)
And you must be...
BLONDE
Leaving.
She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and
deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.
BLONDE (CONT’D)
In case you get bored.
Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.
COBB
I think you just got blown off...
unless her phone number really does
have only six digits.
Fischer glances at the napkin: “528-491.”
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.
ARIADNE
And why don’t you approve?
ARTHUR
Because it involves telling the
mark that he’s dreaming. Which
involves attracting a lot of
attention to us.
ARIADNE
Didn’t Cobb say never to do that?
ARTHUR
You must’ve noticed by now how much
time Cobb spends doing things he
says never to do.
99.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb turns to Fischer.
COBB
Strange way to make friends.
(off look)
Lifting your wallet, I mean.
Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where
he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.
FISCHER
Goddamn it. The wallet alone’s
worth-
COBB
Five hundred bucks. I know. Don’t
worry, my guys are on it.
FISCHER
Who did you say you were?
Fischer looks at him, curious. Cobb plows on, confident-
COBB
I said I was Rod Green from
Marketing-but I’m not. My name is
Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar
to you. I’m in charge of your
security here.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-
BLONDE
Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?
She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as
the Sub-security approaches...
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
The Blonde fondles Saito’s lapels, getting close.
SAITO
I’m sorry, but...
Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of
infinite reflections created by the elevator’s opposing
mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES. He winks.
SAITO (CONT’D)
(pushing him away)
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
100.
EAMES
You look a bit perkier.
A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.
SAITO
Turbulence on the plane.
EAMES
Feels closer. That’s Yusuf’s
driving.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY
Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING
OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN
FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,
FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the
SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - NIGHT
As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb
trying to place him.
FISCHER
Security? You work for the hotel?
COBB
No. My specialty is subconscious
security.
FISCHER
You’re talking about dreams. You’re
talking about extraction.
COBB
Exactly. My job is to protect
you...
Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne
glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES. Pauses, looks across the bar-
HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...
Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at
Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-
101.
COBB (CONT’D)
My job is to protect you from any
attempt to access your mind through
your dreams.
Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest...
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Eames pulls out Fischer’s wallet, moves to hand it to Saito,
then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cast to find... The
SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his
father blowing on it. The elevator doors open and Eames steps
off. HANDS Saito the wallet.
EAMES
Get off at a different floor and
keep moving. Dump the wallet, then
meet me in the lobby. The security
will try to track it down. We need
to buy Cobb a little more time.
The doors close. Saito puts the wallet in his pocket. He
COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb looks over Fischer’s shoulder to see a SUITED MAN
watching him. Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.
COBB
You’re not safe here.
Cobb steps away from the bar. Fischer does not move.
COBB (CONT’D)
Trust me. They’re coming for you.
Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER ECHOES, and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY
GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a
Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUNWIND
AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR’S
SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WECUT
TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET
Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-
102.
COBB
Strange weather, huh?
A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-
COBB (CONT’D)
You feel that?
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the
windows. Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather,
PUZZLED. Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.
ARIADNE
What’s happening?
ARTHUR
Cobb’s drawing Fischer’s attention
to the strangeness of the dream.
That’s making his subconscious look
for the dreamer. For me.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY
At the end of the alley- Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD
RIGHT TURN- we move into EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS
IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS
The liquid in Fischer’s drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF
THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.
COBB
Very odd-the weather, the
gravity...
Fischer looks around the bar- it’s as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS
SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...
COBB (CONT’D)
But I can explain all this. You’ve
actually been trained for this.
(Fischer nods)
Think of the strangeness of the
weather, the shifts in gravity.
None of this is real...
103.
(MORE)
(beat)
We’re in a dream.
Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All
through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.
COBB (CONT’D)
The simplest test of what I’m
saying is for you to try and
remember anything about the way you
arrived in this hotel... okay?
Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around
them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach.
COBB (CONT’D)
Breathe. Remember the training.
Accept the fact that we’re in a
dream. That’s why I’m here
protecting you.
As Fischer considers this we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY
Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street,
swerving through traffic and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING
The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENTFISCHER
So you... you’re not real?
The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.
COBB
No. I’m a projection of your
subconscious. I was put in place to
protect you in the event that
extractors pulled you into a dream.
I believe that’s what has happened.
Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men
approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-
104.
COBB (CONT’D)
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING
Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he
walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them-
The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up
the stairs- then PUSHES him into-
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-
FISCHER
Hey-
Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb
KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN
comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-
BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and
SHOOTS the First Man.
FISCHER (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing.
COBB
Look at the gun in his hand.
Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb
opens the First Man’s jacket to show Fischer his holster and
sidearm.
COBB (CONT’D)
These men were sent to abduct you.
Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.
COBB (CONT’D)
If I’m going to help you, I need
you to be calm.
Fischer remembers something.
FISCHER
If this is a dream, I have to kill
myself and wake up-
Fischer raises the gun towards his head-
COBB
I wouldn’t do that-they’ve probably
got you sedated. If you pull that
trigger, you might not wake up, you
might drop into a lower dream
state.
105.

Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you
just have to remember it...
Fischer lowers his gun.

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man.
Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and
DROPS Fischer’s WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell
as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491.
INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS
Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room
safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.
ARTHUR
So, if everything’s correct, this
room should be directly below 528.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.
COBB
What do you remember from before
this dream?
FISCHER
(thinking)
Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.
(looks up)
Christ-we’ve been kidnapped.
COBB
Where were they holding you?
FISCHER
They had us... in the back of a
van...
COBB
Your body’s bouncing around in the
back of a van right now-that
explains the gravity shifts.
FISCHER
It was... to do with a safe...
Christ, why’s it so hard to
remember?
106.
COBB (CONT'D)
COBB
It’s like trying to remember a
dream after you’ve woken up. It
takes years of practice to do it
easily. So, you and Browning have
been pulled into this dream so they
can steal something from your mind.
What?
FISCHER
They wanted a combination to a
safe... they demanded the first
numbers to pop into my head.
COBB
That’s them extracting a locator.
FISCHER
A locator?
COBB
A number from your own
subconscious. It can be used any
number of ways...
(thinking)
This is a hotel. Room numbers. What
was the number you gave them?
FISCHER
5, 2... something... it was a long
number. 528... 528, 4 something.
COBB
(opens phone)
Well, we know where to start.
(into phone)
Fifth floor.
INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS
Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair,
attaching the explosives to the ceiling.
ARIADNE
Do you use a timer?
ARTHUR
No, I have to judge it myself. Once
you’re all asleep up in room 528, I
wait ‘til Yusuf starts his kick...
ARIADNE
How will you know?
107.
ARTHUR
His music warns me it’s coming,
then the van hitting the barrier of
the bridge should be unmistakablethat’s
when I blow the floor out
from underneath us and we get a
nice synchronized kick. Too soon,
and we won’t get pulled out; too
late and I won’t be able to drop
us.
ARIADNE
Why not?
ARTHUR
The van will be in free fall. I
can’t drop us with no gravity.
Arthur finishes setting the charges.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the
other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames.
SAITO
I see you’ve changed.
BROWNING
I’m sorry?
Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito’s eye.
SAITO
I’m... I mistook you for a friend.
BROWNING
Good-looking fellow, I’m sure.
Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames.
EAMES
That’s Fischer’s projection of
Browning. We’ll keep an eye on how
he behaves-
SAITO
Why?
EAMES
How he acts will tell us if
Fischer’s starting to suspect his
motives the way we want him to.
108.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are
waiting in the corridor.
COBB
They work for me.
Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb
draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.
INT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS
Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur
and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames
shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-
ARTHUR
Mr. Charles!
Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.
COBB
You know what this is?
Fischer’s eyes roam over the dials and plungers.
FISCHER
I think so. But I don’t understand.
COBB
They were going to put you under.
FISCHER
I’m already under.
COBB
Under again.
FISCHER
A dream within a dream?
ARTHUR
Shhhh!
Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the
lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS
the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun
in their face. IT IS BROWNING.
Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.
FISCHER
Uncle Peter. What’s going on?
Cobb pulls the key from Browning’s hand: ROOM 528.
109.
COBB
You said you were kidnapped
together?
FISCHER
Not exactly, they already had him.
They’d been torturing him...
COBB
You saw them torture him?
Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.
FISCHER
The kidnappers are working for you.
BROWNING
No, Robert-
FISCHER
You’re trying to get that safe
open. To get the alternate will.
Browning looks up at Fischer.
BROWNING
Fischer Morrow’s been my entire
life. I can’t let you destroy it.
FISCHER
I’m not going to throw away my
inheritance. Why would I?
BROWNING
I couldn’t take the chance of you
rising to your father’s final
taunt.
FISCHER
What taunt?
BROWNING
That will. I’m sorry, Robert, but
it’s his final insult. A challenge
to build something for yourself.
He’s telling you that you aren’t
worthy of his achievements.
Fischer takes this in. Devastated.
FISCHER
That he was “disappointed?”
110.
BROWNING
I’m so sorry. But he was wrong.
You’ll make his company even
greater than he ever could.
COBB
Your godfather’s lying, Robert.
Fischer turns to Cobb.
FISCHER
How do you know?
COBB
It’s what I do. He’s hiding
something.
Cobb looks at Browning.
COBB
Let’s find out what.
Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism.
Browning watches. Silent.
COBB
Let’s do to him what he was going
to do to you.
Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.
COBB
We’ll penetrate his subconscious
and find out what he doesn’t want
you to know.
Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve,
offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other-
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.
ARTHUR
He’s out.
ARIADNE
Wait, Cobb-I’m lost. Whose
subconscious are we going into?
COBB
Fischer’s. I told him it was
Browning’s so he’d come with us as
part of our team.
ARTHUR
(impressed)
He’s going to help us break into
his own subconscious.
111.
COBB
That’s the idea. He’ll think that
his security is Browning’s and
fight them to learn the truth about
his father.
Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one
by one. Cobb is last.
COBB
Fischer’s subconscious is going to
run you down hard.
ARTHUR
I’ll lead them on a merry chase.
COBB
Be back in time for the kick.
ARTHUR
I’m on it.
Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,
BILLOWING like those in Mal’s suite- a GLIMPSE of someone
(Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY
CLOSE ON Cobb’s face, staring. Fixed.
ARIADNE (O.S.)
Cobb? Cobb?
Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.
ARIADNE
What’s down there?
COBB
Hopefully, the truth we want
Fischer to learn.
ARIADNE
I meant what’s down there for you?
Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer’s
earshot.
COBB
You’re the dreamer. I need you to
draw the security away from the
complex.
112.
EAMES
Then who guides Fischer in? You?
COBB
If I know the route... we could be
compromised.
Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.
ARIADNE
I designed the place.
COBB
No. You’re with me.
SAITO (O.S.)
I could do it.
They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.
COBB
Eames, brief Saito on the route
into the complex. What we’re
looking for is going to be in the
most heavily fortified section.
That north tower.
Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD
on the snow. Looks at Saito.
COBB
Mr. Fischer, you’re going in with
Mr. Saito.
FISCHER
You’re not coming in?
COBB
You have to do this on your own.
You have to get in there, break
into your godfather’s mind and find
out the truth about your father.
Cobb taps Fischer’s radio mike.
COBB
Keep this live at all times. I’ll
be listening in, covering you.
(holds up the sniper
rifle)
The windows on the upper floors are
big enough that I can cover you
from that south tower.
113.
Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT
Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder.
He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a
last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor...
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY
A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back
to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER
FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf’s window as
the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the
bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB
it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back
of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused
MARKETINT.
HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN
emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding
up. The BOOMS are louder, and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY
The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the
driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the vanthe
SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike
creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE
BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.,
tossing the rider like a rag doll-
Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON
RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the
van’s side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van
starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHESCUT
TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to
TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds
a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD
BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor
SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILINGas
wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into-
114.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY
SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING
along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND
ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Arthur and the Security Man DROP to the floor, Arthur on top.
Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS NEAR BRIDGE - DAY
The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then
SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up
ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are
starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-
YUSUF
Bugger.
Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines
up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the
barrier onto the bridge-
The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle
off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security
Man inside starts FIRING on the van...
INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
Arthur RACES down the steps- OPENS the door to the fourth
floor- spots SECURITY MEN outside room 491.
ARTHUR
Hey!
They TURN- he DARTS back into the stairwell- RACES down the
stairs- the Security Men follow- they start SHOOTING, and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY
Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He
reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.
115.
EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS
out on skis and SNOWMOBILES to investigate.
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the
mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE - DAY
Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a
BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the
S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND
HAND TICKING SLOWLY...
YUSUF
Sod it. I hope your ready.
He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place
HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur’s head. As he does so, he
notices Saito’s bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAYEdith
Piaf’s “Non, je ne regrette rien” starts up and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL
TONES- he looks up PANICKEDARTHUR
No, Yusuf. Too soon!
SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY
Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
Cobb? Are you hearing that?
Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW.
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a
patrol passes beneath his position.
116.
EAMES
I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at
first I thought it was just wind...
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb is listening intently. The “wind” changes pitch.
COBB
No, it’s music. Dammit.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
What do we do?
COBB
We move fast. Saito, did you copy?
EXT. MOUNTAINS, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-
SAITO
We’re going as fast as we can.
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.
ARIADNE
How long do we have?
COBB
Yusuf’s about ten seconds from the
jump, which gives Arthur about
three minutes, which gives us about-
ARIADNE
Sixty minutes.
COBB
The route you gave them, can they
do it in under an hour?
ARIADNE
I don’t think so. They’ve still got
to climb down to the middle
terrace.
COBB
They need a new route-a direct
route.
ARIADNE
The building’s designed as a
labyrinth.
117.
COBB
There must be access routes that
cut through the maze.
(into radio)
Eames?
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Subsecurity
in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb turns to Ariadne.
COBB
Did Eames add any features?
ARIADNE
Yes.
COBB
What did he add?
Ariadne looks at Cobb.
ARIADNE
I shouldn’t tell you. If Mal-
COBB
There’s no time-what did he add?
ARIADNE
Utility closets, trap doors...
COBB
What about service features? Did he
add any large pipes or-
ARIADNE
Ducts. He added an air duct systemit
doesn’t follow the maze. They
can use it to go straight from the
outer walls to the upper tower.
COBB
Explain it to them.
ARIADNE
(into radio)
Saito?
EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito is using a hammer to tap in a belay.
118.
SAITO
Go ahead.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY
Yusuf looks at the Security Man in the S.U.V., gives him the
finger and hits the GAS- RACING BACKWARDS at the barrier...
and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY - NIGHT
Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and-
IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at
him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the
edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs.
ARTHUR
Paradox.
Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to
the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY
In SLOW MOTION- the van SMASHES THROUGH THE CONCRETE BARRIERand
we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Arthur is SPRINTING down the corridor when a TREMENDOUS CRASH
sends him FLYING into the air- and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY
A MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley-
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he
sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN
AN AVALANCHE-
119.
EXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is
below, near the bottom of the sheer face-
SAITO
Look out!
Saito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE
down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we-
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. VAN - DAY
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van emerges from the concrete
balustrade and starts FALLING- and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Arthur is still FLYING through the corridor, NOT LANDINGGRAVITY
HAS DISAPPEARED... he scrambles for a handhold,
GRABBING a sconce- and we-
CUT TO:
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY
Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex.
ARIADNE
What was that?
COBB
The kick.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
Cobb? Did we miss it?
COBB
Yeah, we missed it.
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames is lying on the snow.
EAMES
What the hell do we do now?
COBB (OVER RADIO)
Finish the job before the next
kick.
120.
EAMES
What next kick?
EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio.
COBB
When the van hits the water. I
figure Arthur’s got a couple
minutes and we’ve got about twenty.
Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex.
EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They
find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They
blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.
INT./EXT. VAN - DAY
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van seems SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR
TEN STORIES ABOVE THE RIVER... and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
In ZERO GRAVITY, Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491,
opens it. He looks at the charges planted on the ceiling.
ARTHUR
How the hell do I drop you?
He PULLS the charges from the ceiling. Hurrying. And we-
CUT TO:
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system. Saito is
falling behind, coughing up blood.
EXT. UPPER TERRACE, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him
unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs
towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.
INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
A guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb
SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.
121.
ARIADNE
(she points)
That’s the antechamber outside the
strongroom.
Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber.
COBB
What about the strongroom? Doesn’t
it have any windows?
ARIADNE
Wouldn’t be very strong if it did.
(off look)
Look, if you wanted to design it
yourself-
COBB
It’s fine. Better hope that we like
what Fischer finds in there.
Cobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see
three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more
inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne
watches through binoculars, appalled.
ARIADNE
These projections, they’re part of
his subconscious?
COBB
Yeah.
ARIADNE
Are you destroying those parts of
his mind?
COBB
No, of course not. They’re just
projections.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
Cobb? Something’s wrong?
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames is watching the patrols HEAD BACK towards the complex.
EAMES
They’re heading your way. Like they

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Cobb hears this. Concerned.

COBB
Buy us some time.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
On my way.
EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS
Eames TAKES OFF towards the base of the complex. And we=
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT
Arthur FLOATS into the room. The SLEEPERS are floating,
loosely connected by their tubes. Arthur looks at them, MIND
RACING. He PULLS Cobb towards Eames, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY
Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the
anteroom. Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls out
his radio. Fischer looks at him- he is PALE, SHIVERING.
Fischer takes the radio, WHISPERS into it.
FISCHER
(into radio)
We’re here. Are we clear to
proceed?
INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEC - CONTINUOUS
Cobb SCANS the anteroom through the scope-it looks clear.
COBB
You’re clear, but hurry-there’s an
army headed your way...
Ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex...
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
The SQUELCH from the radio is too loud- Fischer GRABS it and
turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate...
EXT. BASE OF THE HOPISTAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Eames is setting MINES along the LOWEST WALL of the
structure. He moves carefully-there is a SHEER DROP below the
wall...

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Cobb SPOTS something through his scope. Something above the
main windows, glimpsed through the side of the skylight.
COBB
Shit. There’s someone else in

Cobb prepares to fire. Ariadne GRABS the radio-
ARIADNE
Fischer, stop! It’s a trap!-
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he
carefully lifts the grate. He motions for Saito to stay...
INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Cobb TENSES to fire.
COBB
Come on... a little lower... a

COBB FREEZES- IT IS MAL IN HIS SIGHTS. Ariadne puts up her

ARIADNE
Cobb, that’s not really her-
Cobb turns to her-
COBB
How can you know that?
INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
Fischer moves into the antechamber, cautious-
FISCHER

Fischer turns up the volume-

Fischer, look out!-
Mal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him-
MAL
Hello.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Cobb looks at Ariadne-
ARIADNE
Cobb, she’s just a projection.
Fischer... he’s real.
Cobb thinks. Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL
SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES
DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED.
ARIADNE
Eames? Get to the anteroom now!
They run for the door.
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito STARTS as he hears the shot. He starts edging forwards,
clutching his belly. And we-

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT
The sleepers are floating in a rough stack, top-and-tailed.
Arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to
bind the sleepers together. And we-

INT./EXT. VAN - DAY
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van CREEPS DOWNWARDS, still high
above the river... and we-
CUT TO:

Arthur PUSHES the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator.
He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- GRABS
the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we-
CUT TO:
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY
Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes-
INT. ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing
over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.
125.
EAMES
What happened?
ARIADNE
Mal killed Fischer-
COBB
I wouldn’t shoot her.
Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer’s
jacket open-
COBB
It won’t do any good-
Eames SHOCKS Fischer’s chest...
COBB
Even if you could revive his body,
his mind’s trapped down there. It’s
over.
Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.
EAMES
So that it, then? We failed.
COBB
I’m sorry.
EAMES
It’s you who doesn’t get back to
your family.
Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors.
EAMES
I wanted to know what was going to
happen in there. I think we had
this one.
ARIADNE
There’s still a way: We follow
Fischer down-
They look at her.
EAMES
We’re almost out of time-
ARIADNE
Down there they’ll be enough time.
We’ll find him-soon as you hear
Arthur’s music start, you use the
defibrillator to revive him-we give
him his own early kick from below.
126.
(MORE)
Get him in there-
(points to doors)
Then, as the music ends you blow
the hospital and we all ride the
kick back up through the layers.
Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.
EAMES
Okay, Saito can hold them off while
I plant the rest of the charges.
COBB
Saito’s not going to last, Eames.
ARIADNE
We have to try!
EAMES
Go for it, but I’m taking the kick
whether you’re back or not...
Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to
Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-
ARIADNE
Can I trust you to do what’s
needed? Mal’s down there-
COBB
And I can find her. She’ll have
Fischer.
ARIADNE
How do you know?
COBB
She wants me to come after him. She
wants me back down there with her.
Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.
Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button-
WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-
EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY
Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN
BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are
DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb
WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up
at the crumbling city around them.
ARIADNE
This is your world?
127.
ARIADNE (CONT'D)
COBB
It was. And this is where she'll
be.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY
Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges
on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the
other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As
he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety
systems of the elevator, we move into SLOW MOTION, the
fireballs FLAMING OUT in graceful licks and we-
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY
Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator
paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the ductpulls
Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.
EAMES
Come on, Saito. I need you to cover
Fischer while I plant the charges.
Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the
window− pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He
watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...
Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-
EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS
SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the
glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COAST (LIMBO)- DAY
Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings− every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.
ARIADNE
You built all this?
COBB
We both did.
128.
ARIADNE
It's incredible.
COBB
We built for years. Then, when that
got stale, we started in on the
memories.
A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.
Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.
COBB
This is our neighborhood.
ARIADNE
(confused)
From what city?
COBB
No. Our neighborhood.
(pointing)
That was our first apartment...
then we moved to that building...
we got that small house when Mal
became pregnant.
ARIADNE
You reconstructed them all from
memory?
COBB
We had time.
Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.
ARIADNE
What's that?
COBB
The house Mal grew up in.
ARIADNE
Will she be in there?
COBB
No. Come on-
Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.
129.
INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS
Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the
elevators.
COBB
We both wanted a house, but we both
loved skyscrapers. In the real
world we had to choose. Not here.
INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS
Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of
bullets.
ARIADNE
How do we send Fischer back?
COBB
We need some kind of kick.
ARIADNE
What?
COBB
I'll improvise.
Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors
open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.
COBB
There's something you have to
understand about me. About
inception. You see, an idea is like
a virus...
Cobb leads her out of the lift...
INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS
Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous
interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the
corridor towards the back of the house...
COBB
Resilient...
(turns to Ariadne)
Highly contagious, and an idea can
grow. The smallest seed of an idea
can grow to define or destroy your
world...
Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the
table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of
Limbo stretching off behind it.
130.
MAL
The smallest idea, such as... "Your
world is not real."
Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal.
MAL
A simple little thought that
changes everything...
Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal. And we-
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
Arthur FLIES back down the shaft to the top of the elevator,
SQUEEZES past the car to the bottom and starts to set the
MAIN CHARGES ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY
Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry. It is only now that
we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE. Mal looks at Ariadne.
MAL
So certain of your world. Of what's
real. Do you think he is-
(points at Cobb)
Or do you think he's as lost as I
was?
COBB
I know what's real.
MAL
What are the distinguishing
characteristics of a dream? Mutable
laws of physics? Tell that to the
quantum physicists. Reappearance of
the dead? What about heaven and
hell? Persecution of the dreamer,
the creator, the messiah? They
crucified Christ, didn't they?
COBB
I know what's real.
MAL
No creeping doubts? Not feeling
persecuted, Dom? Chased around the
globe by anonymous corporations and
police forces? The way the
projections persecute the dreamer?
131.
Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying.
MAL
Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in
one reality anymore. So choose.
Choose your reality like I did.
Choose to be here. Choose me.
COBB
(rising anger)
I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I
have to get back to them. Because
you left them. You left us.
MAL
You're wrong, Dom. You're confused...
our children are here-
A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back
to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches,
moved. Mal leans in close.
MAL
(whispers)
And you'd like to see their faces
again, wouldn't you, Dom?
COBB
Our real children are waiting for
me up above.
And we-
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the
car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.
He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his
shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL FORTRESS - DAY
Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying
to ascend the terraces. He DUCKS to the ground to avoid HEAVY
FIRE− starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the
base of the terraces-
132.
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through
the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness...
And we-
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY
Mal laughs at Cobb.
MAL
(laughs)
Up above? Listen to yourself. You
judged me for believing the very
same thing.
Mal points at the children-
MAL
These are our children. Watch.
(turns to the kids)
Hey, James! Philippa?!
The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.
COBB
They're not real, Mal. Our real
children are waiting for us-
The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes.
MAL
You keep telling yourself that but
you don't believe it-
COBB
I know it-
MAL
And what if you're wrong? What if
I'm what's real?
Cobb is silent.
MAL
You keep telling yourself what you
know... but what do you believe?
What do you feel?
Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling.
COBB
Guilt. I feel guilt. And however
confused I might get.
133.
(MORE)
However lost I might seem... it's
always there. Telling me something.
Reminding me of the truth.
MAL
What truth?
COBB
That you were wrong to doubt our
world. That the idea that drove you
to question your reality was a
lie...
MAL
How could you know it was a lie?
COBB
Because it was my lie.
MAL
(realizing)
Because you planted the idea in my
mind.
COBB
Because I performed inception on my
own wife, then reaped the bitter
rewards...
ARIADNE
Why?
COBB
We'd become lost in here. Living in
a world of infinite possibilities.
A world where we were gods. I
realized we needed to escape, but
she'd locked away her knowledge of
the unreality of this world...
INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning
top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.
COBB
I couldn't make Mal understand that
we needed to break free. To die. So
I started to search our world...
Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...
INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...
COBB
Searching for the right place in
her mind...
134.
COBB (CONT'D)
INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S
CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside...
COBB
And when I found that place, that
secret place where she had shut
away her knowledge years before, I
broke it open...
INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes
to the doll's house...
COBB
I broke into the deepest recess of
her mind, to give her the simplest
little idea.
INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the
shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side.
COBB
A truth that she had once known,
but had chosen to forget...
INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe.
IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the
safe...
COBB
That her world was not real.
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING
THROUGH WASTELAND.
COBB (V.O.)
That death was a necessary escape.
They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is
crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-
COBB
You're waiting for a train. A train
that will take you far away. You
know where you hope this train will
take you, but you can't know for
sure. Yet it doesn't matter...
Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks. Replies-
MAL
Because you'll be together.
The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.
Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes. She is
crying.
135.
COBB
I never thought that the idea I'd
planted would grow in her mind like
a cancer. That even after we woke...
INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused. He
moves to the CURTAINS... Mal is on the ledge opposite.
COBB
You'd continue to believe that your
world was not real...
Crying, Mal nods-
MAL
That death was the only escape?
INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.
MAL
You killed me.
Cobb looks at Mal. Whispers-
COBB
I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.
Mal comes in close to Cobb. Looks him over.
MAL
You infected my mind. You betrayed
me. But you can make amends. You
can still keep your promise. We can
still be together... right here. In
our world. The world we built
together.
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Arthur hits "Play" on his music player- Edith Piaf starts to
ring out, Arthur checks his detonator and we-
CUT TO:
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY
Eames races back in- in the relative quiet he notices MASSIVE
LOW-E MUSICAL TONES. He drops his gun and goes to Fischer's
side...
136.
INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
Saito musters all his remaining strength as the guard emerges-
Saito FIRES, dropping the guard, then COLLAPSES, the gun
clattering to the duct floor... Saito is dead.
INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
Eames powers up the defibrillator, puts the paddles on
Fischer's chest, then Pow!- he shocks him, and we-
CUT TO:
INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO)-DAY
LIGHTNING crackles across the sky- Ariadne sees it.
ARIADNE
We need Fischer.
MAL
You can't have him.
Cobb stares at Mal. Mesmerized.
COBB
If I stay, can she take him back?
ARIADNE
Cobb, what are you saying?
MAL
Fischer's on the porch.
ARIADNE
Cobb, you can't do this.
COBB
Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
Ariadne moves onto the porch, high above the metropolis, and
we-
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Arthur nods his head in time with the music, counting down,
holding the detonator. He starts bracing himself, and we-
CUT TO:
137.
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY
Eames recharges the defibrillator. SHOCKS Fischer again, and
we-
CUT TO:
EXT. PORCH, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY
Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the
sky... she looks down to see Fischer, BOUND AND BLOODY, lying
below the rail.
ARIADNE
He's here. And it's time. But you
have to come with us.
Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-
ARIADNE
Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
yourself in here! You have to get
back to your children!
COBB
Send Fischer, I have to stay-
ARIADNE
You can't stay here to be with her-
Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.
COBB
I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
means he's here. I have to stay
here and find him.
Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.
COBB
I can't stay here to be with her
because she's not real.
Mal looks at Cobb, furious.
MAL
Not real? I'm the only thing you do
believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
this feel real, Dom?
She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at
Mal-
138.
COBB
I wish you were. But I couldn't
make you real. I'm not capable of
imagining you in all your
complexity and... perfection. As
you really were. You're the best I
can do. And you're not real.
Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-
ARIADNE
No!
A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.
COBB
What're you doing?
ARIADNE
Improvising.
She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-
Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer
SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY
Eames pulls the defibrillator from Fischer's chest as he
COUGHS AWAKE.
EAMES
Get in there-quick!
Fischer looks up at the double doors. STAGGERS to his feet.
Fischer pushes open the doors to the STRONGROOM.
INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS
Fischer walks into the silent white room. At one end of the
room is a bed. A figure lies in the bed. His FATHER.
Breathing with tremendous difficulty. Dying. And we-
CUT TO:
EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY
Ariadne takes aim at Mal-
COBB
No!
Cobb holds Ariadne's gaze. She lowers the gun. And we-

Eames GRABS the detonator- then moves to the door of the
strongroom...

ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS
The CHARGES on the bottom of the elevator EXPLODE, and we

INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS
A RUMBLE BUILDS as Fischer approaches the bed, overcome with
emotion. His Father sees him. Starts trying to speak. Fischer
leans in...
FATHER
(hoarse whisper)
I... was ... dis ... dis ...
FISCHER
I know, Dad. You were disappointed
that I couldn't be you.
The dying man SHAKES HIS HEAD with surprising energy.
FATHER
(whisper)
I was disappointed... that you
tried.
Fischer hears this. And we-

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
The elevator car is ROCKETED along its track by the explosion-

Arthur is SMASHED against the floor of the car next to the
sleepers who SHUDDER with the force of ACCELERATION- and we-

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY
Eames WATCHES Fischer-

EAMES
(to himself) )
Come on, come on...
INT. STRONGROOM - DAY
The Father collapses back onto the pillow. Fischer starts to
weep. His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when
Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away...
He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers
fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes
5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the
WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a
child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns
to his father, but his father is dead.
Eames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOREXT.
HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS
A line of EXPLOSIONS RIPS ALONG THE LOWER WALL... the ENTIRE
BUILDING STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAINEXT.
PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY
A FIERCE WIND starts HOWLING through the house as the sky
outside DARKENS. Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up
at Ariadne, who HOLDS the railing, FIGHTING the wind-
COBB
That’s the kick-you have to go!
ARIADNE
You’re coming!
COBB
No, I’m not. I’m staying here to
find Saito.
(turns to Mal)
And to say goodbye.
Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing...
ARIADNE
Don’t lose yourself. Find Saito.
And bring him back.
COBB
I will.
Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- FALLING- and we-
INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne DROPS as the FLOOR COLLAPSES- her eyes SNAP OPEN-
141.
EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY
Cobb holds Mal in his arms. The wind DIES...
MAL
We’d be together forever. You
promised me.
COBB
I know. But we can’t. And I’m
sorry.
MAL
You remember when you asked me to
marry you? You said you dreamt that
we’d grow old together.
COBB
And we did...
Mal looks at Cobb... thinking. Remembering.
INSERT CUT: TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE (MAL AND COBB) WALK THROUGH
LIMBO... ACROSS A WASTELAND... TWO ELDERLY HANDS CLUTCH EACH
OTHER AS THEY LIE DOWN ON THE RAILROAD TRACK...
COBB
I miss you more than I can bear...
but we had our time together. And
now I have to let go...
She nods, weakly. Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close...
DYING... and we-

Fischer and his Father’s body DROP AWAYINT.

Ariadne DROPS inside the ROCKETING ELEVATOR, and as it
SMASHES INTO THE TOP OF THE SHAFT Ariadne SMASHES into-
INT./EXT. VAN INTO RIVER - DAY
THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING
THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR...
Fischer’s EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes
out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE
Browning and DRAG him out.
142.
EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS
Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and
GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling
through the rain-impacted water-
INT. VAN, UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are
sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat.
Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around
Saito’s belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a
pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne
GRABS Arthur’s elbow, pulling him away...
EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER
Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.
BROWNING
I'm sorry, Robert.
Fischer stares at the rain on the water.
FISCHER
The will means that Dad wanted me
to be my own man, not live for him.
(turns to Browning) )
And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.
Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle
beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.
EXT. UNDERNEATH BRIDGE IN THE RAIN - MOMENTS LATER
Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily.
ARTHUR
What happened?
ARIADNE
Cobb stayed.
ARTHUR
With Mal?
ARIADNE
No. To find Saito.
Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge.
ARTHUR
He'll be lost...
ARIADNE
No. He'll be alright.
143.
And we-
CUT TO:
EXT. DAWN. CRASHING SURF.
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.
As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we
realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELLED...
INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE - DAY
Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90
years old) watches him.
SAITO
So... have you come to kill me?
Cobb does not look up.
SAITO
I've been waiting for someone to
come for me...
COBB
Someone from your half-remembered
dream...?
Saito peers at Cobb.
SAITO
Cobb? Not possible-he and I were
young men together. And I am an old
man...
COBB
Filled with regret?
Saito REMEMBERS, nods...
SAITO
Waiting to die alone, yes.
Cobb is STARING at something on the table.
COBB
I came back for you... I came to
remind you of what you once knew...
Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to
the polished surface of the table...
COBB
That this world is not real.
144.
The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER
TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.
SAITO
You came to convince me to honor
our arrangement?
COBB
Yes. And to take a leap of faith.
As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the
table between them...
COBB
Come back and we'll be young men
together again.
The elderly Saito looks at Cobb. Nods. And we-
CUT TO:
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - DAY
Ariadne watches Cobb. His eyes are closed.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
Hot towel, sir?
His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod. Ariadne
smiles. Relieved.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
about twenty minutes. Do you need
immigration forms?
Cobb nods. Takes a landing card. Looks around the cabin.
Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's gaze,
SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...
INT. ARRIVALS, LAX - LATER
Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb
up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb
takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods
at him. He nods back. Then moves off...
As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.
Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who
glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,
then moves on...
145.
As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...
INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY
Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-
Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glass-
James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
towards him...
Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.
And we-
FADE OUT.

2.
PILOT
NO! I need the power up -
EXT. THE STRATOSPHERE - CONTINUOUS
The BLACK and RED SKY starts SPINNING HORRIFYINGLY -
INT. COCKPIT - DAY
As the controls RIP themselves free, the pilot SHOUTS and we
-
CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
A man WAKES, nightmare SWEATY. This is COOPER.
YOUNG GIRL’S VOICE
(O.S.)
Dad? Dad?
Cooper turns: in the doorway - his sleepy ten-year-old
daughter. This is MURPH.
COOPER
Sorry. Go back to sleep.
MURPH
I thought you were the ghost.
COOPER
There’s no ghost, Murph.
MURPH
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
COOPER
Maybe Grandpa’s a little too close
to being one himself. Back to
sleep.
MURPH
Were you dreaming about the crash?
COOPER
Back to sleep, Murph.
Murph shuffles back out the door. Cooper moves to the
window. DAWN breaks over an ENDLESS SEA OF CORN ...
3.
ELDERLY FEMALE VOICE
(V.O.)
Corn, sure. But dust. In your ears,
your mouth...
INSERT CUT: AN OLD-TIMER IN CLOSE UP, WATERY-EYED, DESCRIBES
DUST BOWL CONDITIONS.
OLD-TIMER
(V.O.)
Dust just everywhere. Everywhere.
EXT. COOPER’S FARM - MORNING
An old man, handkerchief across his face, sweeps dust out of
the door onto the porch. This is Grandpa (DONALD).
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MORNING
Cooper pours himself coffee as Donald puts grits on the
table. TOM, Cooper’s fifteen-year-old son, stuffs his face.
Murph, wet hair, towel around neck, plays with pieces of a
MODEL (a lunar lander).
DONALD
Not at the table, Murph.
MURPH
Dad, can you fix this?
COOPER
(takes pieces, frowning)
What’d you do to my lander?
MURPH
Wasn’t me.
TOM
Lemme guess - your ghost?
MURPH
It knocked it off my shelf. It
keeps knocking books off.
TOM
There’s no such things as ghosts,
dumb-ass -
4.
COOPER
(to Tom)
Hey -
MURPH
I looked it up, it’s called a
poltergeist.
TOM
Dad, tell her.
COOPER
Murph, you know that’s not
scientific.
MURPH
You say science is about admitting
what we don’t know.
DONALD
She’s got you there.
COOPER
(hands her pieces)
Start looking after our stuff.
Donald looks at Cooper, admonishing. Cooper shrugs.
COOPER
Fine. Murph, you wanna talk
science, don’t just tell me you’re
scared of some ghost - record the
facts, analyze, present your
conclusions.
MURPH
Sure.
Cooper gets up, grabs his keys.
DONALD
Hold up.
(Off look.)
Parent-teacher conferences.
’Parent’ - not ’grandparent’.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The kids pile into an old pickup truck, scraping DUST off
the seats. Cooper, coffee in hand, peers at a black cloud.
5.
COOPER
Dust storm?
DONALD
(shakes his head)
Nelson’s torching his whole crop.
COOPER
Blight?
DONALD
They’re saying it’s the last
harvest for okra. Ever.
Cooper stares at the smoke. Uneasy. Gets into the truck.
COOPER
Shoulda planted corn like the rest
of us.
DONALD
Be nice to Miss Hanley. She’s
single.
COOPER
What’s that supposed to mean?
DONALD
Repopulating the Earth - start
pulling your weight.
COOPER
Start minding your business.
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DIRT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper sips his coffee, steering while Murph shifts -
COOPER
Okay, gimme second -
Murph wrestles the long gear stick into second. Cooper sips.
COOPER
Now third -
Murph struggles to find third - GRIND.
TOM
Find a gear, dumb-ass.
6.
MURPH
Shut up, Tom!
BANG - A TIRE BLOWS OUT. Cooper stops the truck.
TOM
What’d you do, Murph?
COOPER
She didn’t do anything. We lost a
tire is all.
TOM
Murphy’s Law.
MURPH
Shut up, Tom.
Cooper gets out of the truck, checks the flat, turns to Tom.
COOPER
Grab the spare.
TOM
That is the spare.
COOPER
Okay, patch kit.
TOM
How’m I supposed to patch it out
here?
COOPER
Figure it out. I’m not always going
to be here to help you.
Tom moves to the back of the truck. Murph is there.
MURPH
Why’d you and Mom name me after
something bad?
COOPER
We didn’t.
MURPH
Murphy’s Law?
COOPER
Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean bad stuff
will happen. It means ’whatever can
happen, will happen’. And that
sounded just fine to us.
7.
Murph frowns, hearing something ...
COOPER
What?
Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLE. Cooper GRABS Murph
as a DRONE SOARS low overhead -
COOPER
Come on!
Cooper jumps into the truck - he pulls out a laptop and
antenna hands them to Murph - shouts at Tom -
COOPER
Get in!
TOM
(jack in hand)
What about the tire?
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK THROUGH FIELDS - MOMENTS LATER
Close on the SHREDDING TIRE as the truck BARRELS through
cornfields. Murph fires up the laptop. Cooper strains to see
through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon -
TOM
There!
To the right, the dark shape of the drone, cruising low over
the fields. Cooper JERKS the wheel - the drone has long,
thin wings like a U-2, but no cockpit.
COOPER
Indian air force surveillance
drone. Solar cells could power an
entire farm.
(To Tom.)
Take the wheel -
Tom takes the wheel - Cooper hands Murph the antenna.
COOPER
Keep it pointed right at it -
Cooper works the laptop - the screen fills with Hindi.
Faster, Tom. I’m losing it.
Tom WEAVES through the corn - they round a corner, almost
HIT a HARVESTER - BANG - the truck loses a wing mirror -
Ahead the drone SOARS, banking, pulling away -
8.
The truck BURSTS out of the corn, Cooper’s nose is in the
laptop.
TOM
Dad?
COOPER
Almost got it. Don’t stop.
In front of them, the drone plummets from view into the next
valley - the path ahead leads to a three-hundred-foot drop.
TOM
DAD ...
Cooper looks up.
COOPER
Tom!
Tom locks up the brakes. Cooper looks at him - he shrugs.
TOM
You told me to keep going.
Cooper grabs the laptop and opens the door.
COOPER
Guess that answers the ’if I told
you to drive off a cliff’ scenario.
Murph is still pointing the antenna.
MURPH
We lost it.
COOPER
(smiles)
No, we didn’t.
The DRONE SOARS BACK OVER THEM - Cooper is moving his
fingers across the track pad, PILOTING THE DRONE.
As the kids watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring over them,
banking above the valley. Cooper crouches next to Murph.
COOPER
Want to give it a whirl?
Murph, guided by Cooper, moves her fingers across the track
pad - the massive drone BANKS in response. Murph is in
heaven.
9.
COOPER
Let’s set her down next to the
river.
EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER
The truck limps up to the drone. Cooper and the kids climb
down. Cooper runs a hand along the smooth carbon flank of
the aircraft.
TOM
How long you think it’s been up
there?
COOPER
Delhi mission control went down
same as ours, ten years ago.
TOM
It’s been up there ten years? Why’d
it come down so low?
COOPER
Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it
came down looking for something.
MURPH
What?
COOPER
Some kind of signal. Who knows?
Cooper finds an access hatch. Pries it open. Examines the
black-box brain of the machine.
MURPH
What are you going to do with it?
COOPER
Give it something socially
responsible to do, like drive a
combine.
MURPH
Couldn’t we just let it go? It’s
not hurting anyone.
Cooper looks down at his daughter. Good kid.
COOPER
This thing has to adapt, just like
the rest of us.
10.
EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL - DAY
The truck pulls up to school, drone fuselage hanging out.
COOPER
How’s this work? You guys come
with?
TOM
I’ve got class. But she ...
Pats Murph on shoulder.
Needs to wait.
Murph glares at Tom as he hops out.
COOPER
Why? What?
MURPH
Dad, I had a thing ... well,
they’ll tell you about it. Just try
and ...
COOPER
Am I gonna be mad?
MURPH
Not with me. Just try not to -
COOPER
Relax, I got this.
Murph pulls out a notebook. Starts drawing a BARCODE.
INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER (MORNING)
Cooper enters, awkward. The PRINCIPAL (male, fifties) turns
from the window.
PRINCIPAL
Little late, Coop.
(Indicates chair.)
Guess you had to stop off at the
Asian fighter plane store.
COOPER
(sits, smiles)
Actually, sir, it’s a surveillance
drone. With outstanding solar
cells.
11.
Cooper nods at Murph’s teacher, Ms Hanley, thirties,
attractive.
PRINCIPAL
We got Tom’s scores back. He’s
going to make an excellent farmer.
Congratulations.
The Principal slides a paper across the desk.
COOPER
(taken aback)
What about college?
PRINCIPAL
The university only takes a
handful. They don’t have resources
-
COOPER
I’m still paying taxes - where’s
that go? There’s no more armies.
PRINCIPAL
Not to the university. Coop, you
have to be realistic.
COOPER
You’re ruling him out for college
now? He’s fifteen.
PRINCIPAL
Tom’s score simply isn’t high
enough.
COOPER
What’re you? About a
thirty-six-inch waist?
(Beat.)
Thirty-inch inseam?
PRINCIPAL
I’m not sure I see what -
COOPER
You’re telling me you need two
numbers to measure your own ass,
but just one to measure my son’s
future?
Ms Hanley stifles a laugh. The Principal shoots her a look.
12.
PRINCIPAL
You’re a well educated man, Coop. A
trained pilot -
COOPER
And an engineer.
PRINCIPAL
Okay. Well, right now the world
doesn’t need more engineers. We
didn’t run out of planes, or
television sets. We ran out of
food.
Cooper leans back. He’s not going to win this one.
PRINCIPAL
The world needs farmers. Good
farmers, like you. And Tom.
(Smiles benignly.)
We’re a caretaker generation. And
things are getting better. Maybe
your grandchildren -
COOPER
Are we done, sir?
PRINCIPAL
No. Ms Hanley is here to talk about
Murph.
Cooper shifts his gaze to Ms Hanley.
MS HANLEY
Murph’s a bright kid. A wonderful
kid, Mr Cooper. But she’s been
having a little trouble ...
Ms Hanley places a textbook on the desk.
She brought this to school, to show
the other kids the section on the
lunar landings ...
COOPER
Yeah, it’s one of my old textbooks,
she likes the pictures.
MS HANLEY
This is an old federal textbook.
We’ve replaced them with corrected
versions.
13.
COOPER
Corrected?
MS HANLEY
Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet
Union.
COOPER
You don’t believe we went to the
moon?
MS HANLEY
(tolerant smile)
I believe it was a brilliant piece
of propaganda. The Soviets
bankrupted themselves pouring
resources into rockets and other
useless machines.
COOPER
’Useless machines’?
MS HANLEY
Yes, Mr Cooper. And if we don’t
want a repeat of the wastefulness
and excess of the twentieth
century, our children need to learn
about this planet, not tales of
leaving it.
Cooper considers this in silence. Looks at Ms Hanley.
COOPER
One of those useless machines they
used to make was called an MRI. And
if we had any of them left, the
doctors might have been able to
find the cyst in my wife’s brain
before she died, rather than
afterwards. Then she could be
sitting here listening to this,
which’d be good, cos she was always
the calmer one ...
Ms Hanley looks at Cooper, embarrassed. Then -
MS HANLEY
I’m sorry about your wife, Mr
Cooper. But Murph got into a fist
fight with several of her
classmates over this Apollo
nonsense and we thought it best to
(MORE)
14.
MS HANLEY (cont’d)
bring you in and see what ideas you
might have for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.
COOPER
Sure. Well, there’s a ball game
tomorrow night, and Murph’s going
through a bit of a baseball phase.
There’ll be candy and soda ...
Ms Hanley looks at him, expectant.
COOPER
I think I’ll take her to that.
Ms Hanley turns to the Principal, not happy.
EXT. PICKUP TRUCK OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
Murph looks up from her notebook at her dad, expectantly.
MURPH
How’d it go?
COOPER
I, uh ... got you suspended.
MURPH
What?!
COOPER
Sorry.
MURPH
Dad! I told you not to -
The CB radio CRACKLES to life.
CB OPERATOR
Cooper? Boots for Cooper.
COOPER
Cooper.
BOOTS
(over radio)
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.
15.
COOPER
Power the controllers down for a
couple minutes.
BOOTS
(over radio)
Did that. You should come take a
look, it’s kinda weird.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
Cooper and Murph pass a slow-moving harvester pulling up to
the house, which is surrounded by AUTOMATED FARM MACHINES.
They’ve nosed up to the house like animals at a Nativity.
Boots, the farm hand, approaches -
BOOTS
One by one they been peeling off
from the fields and heading over.
Cooper pops open the cabin to a harvester. Checks the auto
pilot hooked up to the controls.
BOOTS
Something’s interfering with their
compass ...
Cooper jumps down and heads to the front door. Enters.
BOOTS (O.S.)
Magnetism or some such ...
INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks at the kitchen. Nothing. Murph comes in.
MURPH
What is it, Dad?
A small BANG from upstairs. Cooper heads up.
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph’s bedroom clearly used to be her mother’s. Cooper, in
the doorway, looks at the wall of BOOKS opposite - several
GAPS. He looks down at some books on the floor.
MURPH
Nothing special about which books.
(Off look.)
(MORE)
16.
MURPH (cont’d)
Been working on it, like you said.
Murph holds up her notebook with its barcode.
MURPH
I counted the spaces.
COOPER
Why?
MURPH
In case the ghost’s trying to say
something. I’m trying Morse.
COOPER
Morse?
MURPH
Yeah. Dots and dashes, used for -
COOPER
Murph, I know what Morse code is. I
just don’t think your bookshelf’s
trying to talk to you.
He leaves. Murph, embarrassed, turns back to the shelf.
INT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Donald hands Cooper a beer.
COOPER
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
DONALD
Which is?
COOPER
No idea. If the house was built on
magnetic ore, we’d’ve seen this the
first time we switched on a
tractor.
Donald nods. Sips.
DONALD
Sounds like your meeting at school
didn’t go so well.
17.
COOPER
(sighs)
We’ve forgotten who we are, Donald.
Explorers, pioneers. Not
caretakers.
Donald nods, thoughtful. Weighs up his words.
DONALD
When I was a kid it felt like they
made something new every day. Some
gadget or idea. Like every day was
Christmas. But six billion people
... just try to imagine that. And
every last one of them trying to
have it all.
He turns to Cooper.
This world isn’t so bad. And Tom’ll
do just fine - you’re the one who
doesn’t belong. Born forty years
too late, or forty years too early.
My daughter knew it, God bless her.
And your kids know it. ’Specially
Murph.
COOPER
We used to look up and wonder at
our place in the stars. Now we just
look down and worry about our place
in the dirt.
DONALD
Cooper, you were good at something
and you never got a chance to do
anything with it. I’m sorry. But
that’s not your kids’ fault.
Cooper looks up at the stars above.
OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
May 14th. Never forget. Clear as a
bell. You’d never think ...
INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER REMEMBERS. CUT TO A SECOND
OLD-TIMER ...
SECOND OLD-TIMER
When the first of the real big ones
rolled in ... I thought it was the
end of the world.
18.
EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
The CRACK of ball off bat - a pop-fly caught to a trickle of
applause. Half-filled stands at what looks like a minor
league game.
DONALD
In my day we had real ball players.
Who’re these bums?
As the team runs in from the field we see: NEW YORK YANKEES.
COOPER
Well, in my day people were too
busy fighting over food for
baseball, so consider this
progress.
Murph offers Donald some popcorn.
DONALD
Fine. But popcorn at a ball game is
unnatural. I want a hot dog.
MURPH
(confused)
What’s a hot dog?
Cooper sits with Tom a row in front.
COOPER
The school says you’re gonna follow
in my footsteps. I think that’s
great.
TOM
You think that’s great?
MURPH
You hate farming, Dad. Grandpa
said.
Cooper looks at Donald, who shrugs ’sorry’.
COOPER
What’s important is how you feel
about it, Tom.
TOM
I like what you do. I like our
farm.
19.
On the field: the batter hits one along the ground - it
rolls to an infielder’s foot - but the infielder IGNORES it,
STARING up at the sky. The crowd starts to look up ...
OLD-TIMER (V.O.)
You’ve never seen the like. Black.
Just black ...
INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER CHOKES BACK FEAR AS HE REMEMBERS.
Cooper stares at the horizon, where an ENORMOUS BLACK DUST
STORM IS MASSING. People start leaving, tying handkerchiefs
across their faces.
COOPER
Come on, guys.
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper speeds along as Donald and the kids stuff RAGS into
cracks and vents ... behind them the WALL OF BLACK DUST
ADVANCES, SWALLOWING UP ROADS, BUILDINGS. A nasty SOUND is
developing - the truck ROCKING with GUSTS of wind ...
Suddenly, BLACK DUST ENVELOPS the car, LIGHTNING CRACKLING.
DONALD
It’s a bad one ...
COOPER
Mask up, guys.
Murph and Tom take SURGICAL MASKS out of the glove box.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
VISIBILITY MERE FEET as the dust storm BRUTALIZES the farm.
The truck CRAWLS up to the house. Cooper leans in to try and
see better ... CRACK - a panel of sheet metal SMASHES into
the windshield - Cooper turns - wrestles Murph out of the
truck as Donald blindly stumbles towards the front door with
Tom ...
INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The SHUTTERS BANG as the wind WHIPS around the house,
FORCING JETS OF DUST up through cracks in the window frames,
floorboards ... Donald SLAMS the door. Murph is COUGHING ...
Cooper looks around. Sees dust coming from upstairs.
20.
COOPER
Did you both shut your windows?
Tom nods. Murph looks at Cooper. Runs for the stairs.
COOPER
Wait -
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper gets to the doorway. Murph stands in the middle of
the room, STARING. Cooper SHUTS the window. The dust hangs
in the relative quiet. Murph is staring, TRANSFIXED, at
LINES where dust is FALLING UNNATURALLY FAST, STREAMING DOWN
through the air, collecting on the floor in a PATTERN -
MURPH
The Ghost.
Cooper STARES at dust collecting like snow on power lines...
COOPER
Grab your pillow, sleep in with
Tom.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN - MORNING
Calm. Dust settled.
INT. TOM’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph slips out of bed, wrapped in her blanket. Pads down
the hall, peeks in her bedroom door at -
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper sits, staring at the PATTERN of dust: thick radial
lines, like a CIRCULAR BARCODE. Murph sits down next to her
dad. They STARE at it together. He holds up a coin ...
COOPER
It’s not a ghost ...
Cooper tosses the coin across a line. It SHOOTS at the floor
-
It’s gravity.
21.
INT. SAME - LATER
Donald pokes his head in.
DONALD
I’m dropping Tom, then heading to
town ...
(Looks at dust pattern.)
You wanna clean that up when you’ve
finished praying to it?
Cooper reaches for Murph’s notebook. Starts writing ...
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - LATER
Murph fills a glass of water. Picks up a plate of
sandwiches.
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Follow Murph into the room, to find Cooper standing there.
COOPER
I got something.
Cooper is pointing to the thick and thin radial lines -
Binary. Thick is one, thin is zero
- it’s numbers ... number pairs...
He holds up the notebook to show Murph the number pairs.
Coordinates.
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper and Murph pore over MAPS. Cooper TOSSES one aside,
lays it out on the table. Finds a spot. Looks up at Murph
...
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper packing his truck - sleeping bag, flashlight ...
MURPH
You can’t leave me behind!
COOPER
Grandpa’s back in two hours.
22.
MURPH
You don’t know what you’re going to
find -
COOPER
That’s why I can’t take you.
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper grabs the maps and a bottle of water. He calls up -
COOPER
Murph?
Nothing.
Murph, just wait here for Grandpa.
Tell him I’ll call him on the
radio.
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper drives, map spread on the wheel, looks for a pen -
reaches over to the passenger wheel well - lifts a BLANKET -
Murph is there -
COOPER
JESUS!
The truck WOBBLES as Cooper regains control.
Murph, what are you doing?!
Murph is LAUGHING as she climbs into the passenger seat -
COOPER
It’s not funny -
But Murph’s laugh is infectious.
MURPH
You wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t
for me.
Cooper hands Murph the map.
COOPER
Fair enough. Make yourself
useful...
The pickup cruises down the road, heading for the MOUNTAINS.
23.
EXT. PLAINS APPROACHING MOUNTAINS - DUSK
The tiny pickup is dwarfed by the darkening foothills.
EXT. DIRT ROAD OFF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
Cooper pulls up to a gate in chain-link fence. Murph is
asleep next to him.
COOPER
Murph. Murph.
Murph wakes.
I think this is as far as we get.
Murph glances out at the fence. Closes her eyes again.
MURPH
Why? You didn’t bring the
bolt-cutters?
COOPER
I like your spirit, young lady.
Cooper gets out of the truck, retrieves his bolt-cutters and
comes up to the fence. He looks up and down the road.
Nothing. He reaches out and puts the jaws of the cutters -
WHAM! SPOTLIGHTS IN COOPER’S EYES - A HARSH ELECTRIC VOICE -
VOICE
STEP AWAY FROM THE FENCE.
Cooper drops the cutters, puts his hands in the air -
COOPER
Don’t shoot! My child is in the
car! I’m unarmed! My daughter is -
Murph watches, terrified as, with a ZAP, Cooper DROPS. Murph
SCRAMBLES back along the seat as MASSIVE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.
The door is WRENCHED open - a BLINDING LIGHT
VOICE
DON’T BE AFRAID.
Murph SCREAMS.
24.
INT. BRIGHT, INDUSTRIAL ROOM - LATER
Cooper comes to, sitting in a chair. Opposite him is an
ARTICULATED MACHINE. A VOICE emanates from its side.
MACHINE
How did you find this place?
COOPER
Where’s my daughter?
MACHINE
You had the coordinates for this
facility marked on your map. Where
did you get them?
Cooper leans in to the machine.
COOPER
WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!
Cooper’s scream REVERBERATES. Cooper sizes up the machine.
You might think you’re still in the
Marines, but the Marines don’t
exist anymore, pal. I’ve got grunts
like you mowing my grass ...
The Machine RISES to its full height.
MACHINE
How did you find us?
COOPER
But you don’t look like a lawnmower
to me ... you, I’m gonna turn into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner -
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
No, you’re not.
Cooper turns to see a businesslike woman in her thirties.
WOMAN
Tars, back down, please.
The machine, TARS, sinks back down.
COOPER
You’re taking a risk using
ex-military for security. They’re
old, their control units are
unpredictable ...
25.
WOMAN
Well, that’s what the government
could spare.
COOPER
Who are you?
WOMAN
Dr Brand.
COOPER
I knew a Dr Brand once. But he was
a professor -
WOMAN (BRAND)
What makes you think I’m not?
COOPER
And nowhere near as cute.
BRAND
You think you can flirt your way
out of this mess?
COOPER
(honest, scared)
Dr Brand, I have no idea what this
mess is. I’m scared for my little
girl and I want her by my side.
Then I’ll tell you anything you
want to know. Okay?
Brand considers this. Turns to Tars.
BRAND
Get the principals and the girl
into the conference room.
(To Cooper.)
Your daughter’s fine. Bright kid.
(Rises.)
Must have a very smart mother.
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper follows Brand into a corridor. Tars LURCHES behind.
COOPER
It’s pretty clear you don’t want
visitors - why not let us back up
from your fence and be on our way?
26.
BRAND
It’s not that simple.
COOPER
Sure it is. I don’t know anything
about you or this place.
BRAND
Yes, you do.
Brand ushers Cooper through a door into a conference room -
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Where an OLD MAN is crouched down, talking to Murph.
MURPH
Dad!
Murph runs into Cooper’s arms. The Old Man SMILES at Cooper.
OLD MAN
Hello, Cooper.
COOPER
(stunned)
Professor Brand?
MAN AT TABLE (DOYLE)
Just take a seat, Mr Cooper.
Cooper and Murph sit at a table where five people are
waiting - a bespectacled man, WILLIAMS, leans forward to
address Cooper.
WILLIAMS
Explain how you found this
facility.
COOPER
Stumbled across it. Looking for
salvage and I saw the fence -
WILLIAMS
You’re sitting in the world’s best
kept secret - you don’t stumble in.
And you certainly don’t stumble
out.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Cooper, please. Cooperate with
these people.
27.
Cooper looks nervously around the room.
COOPER
It’s hard to explain, but we
learned these coordinates from an
anomaly ...
DOYLE
What sort of anomaly?
COOPER
I don’t want to term it
’supernatural’ ... but ...
Cooper is losing them. Williams leans forward. Serious.
WILLIAMS
You’re going to have to, Mr Cooper.
Real quick.
COOPER
After that last storm, it was a
pattern ... in dust ...
MURPH
It was gravity.
All eyes turn to Murph. She’s said the magic word. Doyle
looks at Professor Brand, excited. Turns to Cooper -
DOYLE
Where was this gravitational
anomaly?
COOPER
Look, I’m happy you’re excited
about gravity, but if you want more
answers from us I’m gonna need
assurances -
WILLIAMS
Assurances?
Cooper looks at Murph. Then covers Murph’s ears.
COOPER
That we’re getting out of here ...
and not in the trunk of some car.
Brand laughs. Williams smiles. Cooper looks confused.
28.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Don’t you know who we are, Coop?
COOPER
No. No, I don’t.
BRAND
(points around table)
Williams, Doyle, Jenkins, Smith,
you already know my father,
Professor Brand. We’re NASA.
COOPER
NASA?
PROFESSOR BRAND
NASA. Same NASA you flew for.
Now Cooper is laughing, too. Murph looks around, confused.
INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Professor Brand shows Cooper the facility.
COOPER
I heard you got shut down for
refusing to drop bombs from the
stratosphere onto starving people.
PROFESSOR BRAND
When they realized killing other
people wasn’t a long term solution
they needed us back. Set us up in
the old NORAD facility. In secret.
COOPER
Why secret?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Public opinion won’t allow spending
on space exploration. Not when
we’re struggling to put food on the
table.
Professor Brand ushers Cooper through a large door -
29.
INT. GREENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Professor Brand gestures to large PLANTATIONS under glass.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Blight. Wheat seven years ago, okra
this year. Now there’s just corn.
COOPER
But we’re growing more than ever -
PROFESSOR BRAND
Like the potatoes in Ireland, like
the wheat in the dust bowl, the
corn will die. Soon.
Brand enters with Murph. She shows her the greenhouses.
COOPER
We’ll find a way, we always have.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Driven by the unshakable faith that
the Earth is ours.
COOPER
Not just ours, but it is our home.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Earth’s atmosphere is 80 percent
nitrogen. We don’t even breathe
nitrogen.
Professor Brand shows him a blighted stalk.
Blight does. And as it thrives our
air contains less and less oxygen
...
Professor Brand gestures over at Murph ...
The last people to starve will be
the first to suffocate. Your
daughter’s generation will be the
last to survive on Earth.
Cooper looks over at Murph. Then back to Professor Brand.
COOPER
Tell me this is where you explain
how you’re going to save the world.
30.
INT. VAST CIRCULAR CHAMBER (LAUNCH FACILITY) - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper and Professor Brand enter like ants in a grain silo.
A ROCKET is on a pad, DWARFED by the circular chamber. Far
above, a ring of mirrors reflects the dawn down into the
facility.
PROFESSOR BRAND
We’re not meant to save the world
... we’re meant to leave it.
Cooper stares up at the rocket. He recognizes the
arrangement of two CRAFT at the top.
COOPER
Rangers.
PROFESSOR BRAND
The last components of our one
versatile ship in orbit, the
Endurance. Our final expedition.
COOPER
What happened to the other
vehicles?
PROFESSOR BRAND
The Lazarus missions.
COOPER
Sounds cheerful.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Lazarus came back from the dead -
COOPER
He had to die in the first place.
You sent people out there looking
for a new home ...
Professor Brand nods.
There’s no planet in our solar
system that can support life ...
and it’d take them a thousand years
to reach the nearest star - that
doesn’t even qualify as futile ...
Where did you send them, Professor?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Cooper, I can’t tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this
craft. You’re the best we ever had.
31.
COOPER
I barely left the stratosphere.
PROFESSOR BRAND
This crew’s never left the
simulator. We can’t program this
mission from Earth, we don’t know
what’s out there. We need a pilot.
And this is the mission you were
trained for.
COOPER
Without ever knowing. An hour ago,
you didn’t even know I was still
alive. And you were going anyway.
PROFESSOR BRAND
We had no choice. But something
brought you here. They chose you.
COOPER
Who’s ’they’?
Professor Brand is silent. Cooper wrestles.
How long would I be gone?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Hard to know. Years.
COOPER
I’ve got my kids, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Get out there and save them.
Cooper considers this. Decides.
COOPER
Who’s ’they’?
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
A man in his forties has the solar system up on the screen.
This is ROMILLY.
ROMILLY
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost fifty years ago.
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere
- I believe you encountered one
yourself ...
32.
COOPER
(realizing)
Over the Straights - my crash -
something tripped my fly-by wire -
ROMILLY
Exactly. But the most significant
anomaly was this ...
Cooper stares at an image of Saturn and its moons. Romilly
zooms in on some stars DISTORTED like ripples in a pond.
ROMILLY
A disturbance of spacetime out near
Saturn.
COOPER
A wormhole?
ROMILLY
It appeared forty-eight years ago.
COOPER
Where does it lead?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Another galaxy.
COOPER
A wormhole isn’t a naturally
occurring phenomenon.
BRAND
Someone placed it there.
COOPER
’They’.
BRAND
And whoever ’They’ are, they appear
to be looking out for us - that
wormhole lets us travel to other
stars. It came along right as we
needed it.
DOYLE
They’ve put potentially habitable
worlds within our reach. Twelve, in
fact from our initial probes.
COOPER
You sent probes into it?
33.
PROFESSOR BRAND
We sent people into it. Ten years
ago.
COOPER
The Lazarus missions.
Professor Brand rises and moves to a MEMORIAL, pointing -
PROFESSOR BRAND
Twelve possible worlds. Twelve
Ranger launches carrying the
bravest humans ever to live, led by
the remarkable Dr Mann.
DOYLE
Each person’s landing pod had life
support for two years - but they
could use hibernation to stretch
that, making observations on
organics over a decade or more.
Their mission was to assess their
world, and if it showed promise,
send a signal, bed down for the
long nap, and wait to be rescued.
COOPER
And if their world didn’t show
promise?
DOYLE
Hence the bravery.
COOPER
Because you don’t have resources to
visit all twelve.
DOYLE
No. Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary, simple
binary ’pings’ on an annual basis
to give some clue as to which
worlds have potential. One system
shows promise.
COOPER
One? Kind of a long shot.
BRAND
One system with three potential
worlds ... no long shot.
34.
COOPER
So if we find a new home, what
then?
PROFESSOR BRAND
That’s the long shot. There’s Plan
A and there’s Plan B. Did you
notice anything strange about the
launch chamber ...
INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper cocks his head, puzzling at the VAST chamber ...
there are structures built SIDEWAYS around the CURVED
walls...
COOPER
This whole facility ... it’s a
vehicle? A space station?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Both. We’ve been working on it, and
others like it for twenty-five
years. Plan A.
COOPER
How does it get off the Earth?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Those first gravitational anomalies
changed everything - suddenly we
knew that harnessing gravity was
real. So I started working on the
theory - and we start building this
station.
COOPER
But you haven’t solved it, yet.
PROFESSOR BRAND
That’s why there’s a Plan B.
INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER
TECHNICIANS work the complex, high-tech lab. Professor Brand
and Cooper follow Brand to a large glass and steel
apparatus.
BRAND
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off
(MORE)
35.
BRAND (cont’d)
this planet. This is one way - Plan
B. A population bomb. Almost five
thousand fertilized eggs, weighing
in at under 900 kilos.
COOPER
How could you raise them?
BRAND
With equipment on board we incubate
the first ten. After that, with
surrogacy, the growth becomes
exponential - within thirty years
we might have a colony of hundreds.
The real difficulty of colonization
is genetic diversity,
(Indicates vials.)
This takes care of that.
Cooper looks at the equipment. Unenthusiastic.
COOPER
We just give up on the people here?
PROFESSOR BRAND
That’s why Plan A’s a lot more fun.
INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE
Professor Brand watches Cooper as he gazes over the vast
tracts of ALGEBRA covering every available surface.
COOPER
Where have you got to?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Almost there.
COOPER
Almost? You’re asking me to hang
everything on an ’almost’?
Professor Brand moves close to Cooper.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m asking you to trust me.
Cooper looks at the passion in Professor Brand’s eyes.
36.
COOPER
All those years of training - you
never told me.
PROFESSOR BRAND
We can’t always be open about
everything, Coop, even if we want
to be. What can you tell your
children about this mission?
Cooper considers this. Uneasy.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Find us a new home. When you
return, I’ll have solved the
problem of gravity. You have my
word.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE DAY
Donald, on the porch, gets to his feet as he sees Cooper’s
pickup approaching. The truck pulls up. Murph TEARS past
Grandpa into the house - Donald looks at Cooper,
questioning.
INT. HALL OUTSIDE MURPH’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries to open the door, but Murph has stacked a desk
and chair against it -
COOPER
Murph?
MURPH
Go! If you’re leaving, just go!
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
Donald looks out at the night, taking it all in.
DONALD
This world never was enough for
you, was it, Coop?
COOPER
I’m not gonna lie to you, Donald -
heading out there is what I feel
born to do and it excites me. That
doesn’t make it wrong.
Donald considers this. Turns to Cooper.
37.
DONALD
It might. Don’t trust the right
thing done for the wrong reason.
The ’why’ of a thing? That’s the
foundation.
COOPER
(sadly)
Well, the foundation’s solid.
(Gestures at landscape.)
We farmers sit here every year when
the rains fail and say ’next year’.
Next year ain’t gonna save us. Nor
the one after. This world’s a
treasure, Donald. But she’s been
telling us to leave for a while
now.
(Stares at the horizon.)
Mankind was born on Earth. It was
never meant to die here.
Donald considers this. Scoops the dust off the rail.
DONALD
Tom’ll be okay. But you have to
make it right with Murph.
COOPER
I will.
DONALD
Without making any promises you
don’t know you can keep.
Cooper meets Donald’s gaze. Looks away, nodding.
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Cooper’s hand, reaching in, removes the chair from the desk,
barricading the door. Murph is lying on the bed, turned
away. Cooper pushes the desk back gently. Enters, quietly.
COOPER
You have to talk to me.
Nothing.
I have to fix this before I go.
Murph turns, tear-stained, angry cheeks blazing -
38.
MURPH
Then I’ll keep it broken so you
have to stay.
Cooper sits down on the bed next to Murph.
COOPER
After you kids came along, your
mother said something I didn’t
really understand - she said, ’I
look at the babies and I see myself
as they’ll remember me.’ She said,
’It’s as if we don’t exist anymore,
like we’re ghosts, like now we’re
just there to be memories for our
kids.’ Now I realize - once we’re
parents, we’re just the ghosts of
our childrens’ futures.
MURPH
You said ghosts don’t exist.
COOPER
That’s right. I can’t be your ghost
right now - I need to exist.
Because they chose me. They chose
me, Murph. You saw it. Murph sits
up.
Points at the shelves. The gaps.
MURPH
I figured out the message ...
(Opens her notebook.)
It was Morse code ...
COOPER
Murph -
MURPH
One word. You know what it is?
Cooper shakes his head sadly. Murph holds out her notebook -
’STAY’. It says ’STAY’, Dad.
COOPER
Oh, Murph.
MURPH
You don’t believe me?! Look the
books! Look at -
Cooper takes his daughter in his arms ...
39.
COOPER
It’s okay, it’s okay ...
Murph buries her head on Cooper’s shoulder, sobbing.
Murph, a father looks in his
child’s eyes and thinks - maybe
it’s them ... maybe my child will
save the world. And everyone, once
a child, wants to look into their
own dad’s eyes and know he saw how
they saved some little corner of
their world. But, usually, by then,
the father is gone.
MURPH
Like you will be.
Cooper looks at his daughter. Lies with head, not heart:
COOPER
No. I’m coming back.
MURPH
When?
Cooper reaches into his pocket. Pulls out two WATCHES.
COOPER
One for you. One for me.
Murph takes the watch, curious. Cooper holds up his watch.
When I’m in hyper-sleep, or travel
near the speed of light, or near a
black hole, time will change for
me. It’ll run more slowly. When I
get back we’ll compare.
MURPH
Time will run differently for us?
COOPER
Yup. By the time I get back we
might even be the same age. You and
me. Imagine that ...
Murph takes this in. Cooper sees he’s made a mistake.
Wait, Murph -
MURPH
You have no idea when you’re coming
back.
Cooper looks at his daughter.
40.
MURPH
No idea at all!
Murph THROWS the watch - TURNS HER BACK.
COOPER
Don’t make me leave like this.
Nothing.
Please. I have to go now.
Murph will not turn around. Cooper tries to rest his hand on
the back of her head, but she shakes it off.
COOPER
I love you, Murph. Forever. And I’m
coming back.
Cooper walks slowly out. A BOOK DROPS FROM THE SHELF. Cooper
turns to look at it. Then leaves.
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper, mechanical, puts his small bag in the truck.
DONALD
How’d it go?
COOPER
Fine. It was fine.
Cooper turns to Tom. Hugs him. Tight enough for both kids.
I love you, Tom.
TOM
Travel safe, Dad.
COOPER
(indicates farm)
Look after our place, you hear?
TOM
Can I use your truck while you’re
gone?
COOPER
(smiles)
I’ll make sure they bring it back
for you.
Cooper gets in. Starts the engine.
Mind my kids for me, Donald.
41.
Donald nods. Cooper pulls out.
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Murph jumps off the bed, GRABS the watch, RUNS downstairs.
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
As Cooper drives he lifts the blanket in the wheel-well
where Murph hid last time. Nothing. And we hear a
COUNTDOWN...
VOICE
(O.S.)
TEN ... NINE ...
EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Murph RACES out of the house, watch in hand -
MURPH
Dad?! DAD?!
VOICE
(V.O.)
EIGHT ... SEVEN ...
But Cooper is a dust trail far down the road.
VOICE
(O.S.)
SIX ... FIVE ...
Murph SOBS as her grandpa puts his arms around her ...
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - CONTINUOUS
As Cooper drives away tears roll down his cheeks
VOICE
(O.S.)
FOUR ... THREE ... TWO ... ONE ...
42.
INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY
VOICE
(O.S.)
IGNITION.
FIRE SHOOTS FROM THE BASE OF THE ROCKET ... The rocket RISES
slowly from the pad, up into the sky ...
INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, in his space helmet, lets the FORCE of the rocket
vibrate through him ...
VOICE
(O.S.)
Stage one ... SEPARATION.
Cooper starts to see the Earth’s curve through the window...
VOICE
(O.S.)
Stage two ... SEPARATION.
And Cooper shakes loose the bonds of Earth.
EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - CONTINUOUS
The rocket RIPS upwards into the sky.
INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper glances around the vibrating, cramped cockpit -
Brand, Doyle, Romilly, Tars. Tars spots Cooper’s glance -
TARS
All here, Mr Cooper. Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony.
Cooper looks at him, confused.
DOYLE
They gave him a humor setting so
he’d fit in with his unit better.
He thinks it relaxes us.
COOPER
A massive, sarcastic robot. What a
great idea.
43.
TARS
I have a cue light I can turn on
when I’m joking, if you like.
COOPER
Probably help.
TARS
You can use it to find your way
back to the ship after I blow you
out the airlock.
Tars looks at Cooper. A beat. An LED turns on. Cooper shakes
his head.
COOPER
What’s your humor setting, Tars?
TARS
One hundred percent.
Cooper turns to the instruments -
COOPER
Take it to seventy-five, please.
EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
The Rangers streak across the Earth, settle into a low
orbit.
INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Quiet. Cooper stares down at the continents sliding by. He
looks over at Brand who is doing the same, abstracted.
COOPER
We’ll get back.
She stares at the land. The oceans.
It’s hard. Leaving everything. My
kids ... your father ...
BRAND
We’re going to spend a lot of time
together ...
COOPER
(nods)
We should learn to talk.
44.
BRAND
And when not to.
(Off look.)
Just trying to be honest.
COOPER
Maybe you don’t need to be that
honest.
(Turns to Tars.)
Tars, what’s your honesty
parameter?
Tars DISENGAGES from the floor and MOVES to the rear airlock
-
TARS
Ninety percent.
COOPER
Ninety? What kind of robot are you?
TARS
Absolute honesty isn’t always the
most diplomatic, or safe form of
communication with emotional
beings.
Cooper turns to Brand. Shrugs.
COOPER
Ninety percent honesty it is, then.
Brand looks at Cooper. Can’t help smiling.
VOICE
(over radio)
Sixty seconds out...
EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
The Rangers approach a RING MODULE, fire retro-thrusters and
slide gracefully into the center of the ring - the last
piece of a large modular craft: the U.S.S. ENDURANCE. Four
LANDERS (including the Rangers) are nestled inside the ring
module.
45.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
Brand, Doyle and Romilly, following Tars, FLOAT through the
cramped cabins, powering up. Tars powers up a second
articulated machine, CASE.
DOYLE
Cooper, you should have control.
INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE (RANGER) - CONTINUOUS
Cooper checks instruments -
COOPER
Talking fine. Ready to spin?
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Doyle and Romilly are strapped in - Brand grabs a handhold -
INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
BRAND
(over radio)
All set.
Cooper hits a switch ...
EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
Thrusters silently fire on the Endurance. It starts
ROTATING.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The crew members settle in as gravity is established.
Romilly is clearly struggling to find his sea legs in the
rotating ship.
BRAND
You okay there?
ROMILLY
Yup. Just need a little time -
BRAND
There should be Dramamine in the
hab pod.
46.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
The crew listen to Professor Brand over the video link -
PROFESSOR BRAND
(on screen)
I miss you already. Amelia, be
safe. Give my regards to Dr Mann.
BRAND
I will, Dad.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(on screen)
Things look good for your
trajectory. We’re calculating two
years to Saturn.
ROMILLY
That’s a lot of Dramamine ...
Cooper thinks about two years. What it means to his kids.
COOPER
(on screen)
Keep an eye on my family, sir.
Specially Murph. She’s a smart one.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(on screen)
We’ll be waiting when you get back
...
INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - LATER
Cooper and Doyle flick switches and check instruments -
PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
... A little older. A little wiser.
But happy to see you ...
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand, Romilly, Tars and Case strap in.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
’Do not go gentle into that good
night ...’
47.
INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper turns to Doyle. HITS the thrusters.
EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
Endurance’s main engines FIRE. The craft PUSHES out of orbit
-
PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
’Rage, rage against the dying of
the light.’ God speed, Endurance.
The craft accelerates away from Earth.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
The crew sets up their CRYO-BEDS. Cooper looks out at the
diminishing Earth floating in the void. Brand joins him.
COOPER
So alone.
BRAND
We’ve got each other - Dr Mann had
it worse.
COOPER
(points at Earth)
I meant them. Look at that perfect
planet. We’re not gonna find
another one like her.
BRAND
No. This isn’t like looking for a
new condo - the human race is going
to be adrift ... desperate for a
rock to cling to while they catch
their breaths. We have to find that
rock. Our three prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain
human life.
Brand shows him a blurry image of a dark blue planet.
Laura Miller’s first. She started
our biology program.
She shows him a red world, just a tiny dot.
And Wolf Edmunds is here.
Cooper hears something in her voice.
48.
COOPER
Who’s Edmunds?
BRAND
(fondly)
Wolf’s a particle physicist.
COOPER
None of them had family?
BRAND
No attachments. My father insisted.
They knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being. I’m
hoping we surprise at least three
of them.
COOPER
Tell me about Dr Mann.
Brand replaces the screen image for a grainy, white orb.
BRAND
Remarkable. The best of us. My
father’s protégé. He inspired
eleven people to follow him on the
loneliest journey in human history.
Scientists, explorers ... That’s
what I love - out there we face
great odds. Death. But not evil.
COOPER
Nature can’t be evil?
BRAND
Formidable, frightening - not evil.
Is a tiger evil because it rips a
gazelle to pieces?
COOPER
Just what we bring with us, then.
BRAND
This crew represents the best
aspects of humanity.
COOPER
Even me?
Brand looks at him. Smiles.
49.
BRAND
Hey, we agreed, ninety percent.
Brand moves to her cryo-bed. Cooper looks out at space.
BRAND
Don’t stay up too late. We can’t
spare the resources.
COOPER
Hey, I’ve been waiting a long time
to be up here -
BRAND
You are literally wasting your
breath.
Cooper nods at her. Joins Tars.
COOPER
Show me the trajectory again.
TARS
Eight months to Mars, then
counter-orbital slingshot around -
Brand’s cryo-bed darkens.
COOPER
(whisper)
Tars? Was Dr Brand -
TARS
Why are you whispering? You can’t
wake them.
COOPER
Were Dr Brand and Edmunds ...
close?
TARS
I wouldn’t know.
COOPER
Is that ninety percent, or ten
percent ’wouldn’t know’?
TARS
I also have a discretion setting.
COOPER
So I gather ...
(Rises.)
(MORE)
50.
COOPER (cont’d)
But not a poker face.
Tars watches Cooper head for the comm. station. He sits down
to record a message. Awkward. Stuck. He dives in -
Hey, guys. I’m about settle down
for the long nap, so I figured I’d
send you an update ...
EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance slips away from the small blue planet ...
COOPER
(V.O.)
The Earth looks amazing from here
... you can’t see any of the dust -
EXT. CORNFIELDS - DAY
A line of dust slides across the shimmering horizon.
COOPER
(V.O.)
Hope you guys are doing great. This
should get to you okay ...
EXT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Donald watches two approaching vehicles kick up dust.
COOPER
(V.O.)
Professor Brand said he’d make sure
of it. Guess I’ll say good night.
Donald recognizes Cooper’s truck ... Murph BURSTS out of the
house -
MURPH
(quiet)
Is it him?
DONALD
I don’t think so, Murph.
Donald rises to meet the truck. Professor Brand gets out.
51.
PROFESSOR BRAND
You must be Donald. Hello, Murph.
MURPH
Why’re you in my dad’s truck?
PROFESSOR BRAND
He wanted me to bring it for your
brother.
Silence. Professor Brand reaches into his briefcase.
He sent you a message -
Murph TURNS and goes back into the house. Donald takes a
disc from Professor Brand.
DONALD
Pretty upset with him for leaving.
PROFESSOR BRAND
If you record messages, I’ll
transmit them to Cooper.
Donald nods. Professor Brand looks up at the house.
Murph’s a bright spark. Maybe I
could fan the flame.
DONALD
She’s already making fools of her
teachers. She should come make a
fool out of you.
Professor Brand smiles. Donald looks up into the blue.
Where are they?
PROFESSOR BRAND
Heading towards Mars ...
EXT. MARS - DAY
The Endurance streaks away from Mars ...
PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
Next time we hear from Cooper,
they’ll be coming up on Saturn.
52.
EXT. SATURN - DAY
The Endurance settles into an orbit around the ringed giant.
TOM
(O.S.)
But they said I can start advanced
agriculture a year early ...
INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, blanket around his shoulders, watches a highly
compressed video of Tom -
TOM
Got to go, Dad. Hope you’re safe up
there.
Tom makes way for Donald:
DONALD
I’m sorry, Coop, I asked Murph to
say hi, but she’s stubborn as her
old man. I’ll try again next time,
stay safe.
The video cuts out. Cooper gets up, puts a pair of EAR BUDS
in his ears and heads into -
OMITTED
INT. HAB POD, RING MODULE - LATER
Cooper enters. Romilly is staring out the window.
COOPER
You good, Rom?
Romilly looks at Cooper.
ROMILLY
It gets to me, Coop. This tin can.
Radiation, vacuum outside -
everything wants us dead. We’re
just not supposed to be here.
Cooper looks at him, sympathetic.
53.
COOPER
We’re explorers, Rom, on the
greatest ocean of all.
Romilly bangs on the side of the ship.
ROMILLY
Millimeters of aluminium. That’s
it. And nothing within millions of
miles that won’t kill us in
seconds.
COOPER
A lot of the finest solo yachtsmen
couldn’t swim. They knew if they
went overboard that was it, anyway.
This is no different.
Romilly considers this. Cooper passes him his ear buds -
COOPER
Here -
And the sounds of a THUNDERSTORM wash over Romilly, sounds
that take us to ...
EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance is a tiny speck before the ringed gassy giant.
INT. NAVIGATION, RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks over Doyle’s shoulder - he’s flicking through
images of star fields, distorted as if through a fish-eye
lens.
COOPER
From the relay probe?
DOYLE
It was in orbit around the wormhole
- each time it swung around we got
images of the other side of the
foreign galaxy.
COOPER
Like swinging a periscope around?
DOYLE
Exactly.
54.
COOPER
So we’ve got a pretty good idea
what we’re gonna find on the other
side?
DOYLE
Navigationally.
Brand approaches.
BRAND
We’ll be coming up on the wormhole
in less than forty-five. Suit up.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - LATER
Cooper straps in, peering out at the inky blackness past
Saturn. Romilly joins him there, excited.
COOPER
(over radio)
Strap in - I’m killing the spin ...
EXT. SATURN - CONTINUOUS
As the Endurance streaks past Saturn, it stops rotating,
headed for a DISTORTED BLUR of stars.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
ROMILLY
There!
He points at the SPHERICAL blur of stars.
ROMILLY
That’s it! That’s the wormhole!
COOPER
Say it, don’t spray it, Rom.
ROMILLY
Cooper, this is a portal, cutting
through spacetime -
(Points.)
We’re seeing into the heart of a
galaxy so far away we don’t even
know where it is in the universe.
Cooper stares at the wormhole as they approach: a massive
spherical lens into another galaxy.
55.
COOPER
It’s a sphere.
ROMILLY
Of course it is. You thought it
would be just a hole?
COOPER
No ... well, in all the
illustrations -
Romilly grabs a piece of paper, draws two points, far apart
-
ROMILLY
In the illustrations they’re trying
to show you how it works -
He pokes a hole in one point with his pen ...
So they say ’You wanna go from here
to there but it’s too far? A
wormhole bends space like this ...’
He folds the paper over and jams the pen through the second
point, connecting them.
ROMILLY
’So you can take a shortcut across
a higher dimension.’ But to show
that, they’ve turned
three-dimensional space ...
(Gestures around.)
Into two dimensions.
(Hold up paper.)
Which turns the wormhole into two
dimensions ... a circle.
(Indicates hole in paper.)
But what’s a circle in three
dimensions?
COOPER
A sphere.
ROMILLY
Exactly.
(Points out window.)
It’s a spherical hole ...
Cooper marvels at the concept. And at the looming sphere ...
And who put it here? Who do we
thank?
56.
COOPER
I’m not thanking anyone till we get
through it in one piece.
OMITTED
EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
As the Endurance SWINGS around the wormhole, the view of the
foreign galaxy SWINGS in opposition, like an ENORMOUS
SHAVING MIRROR ... it’s extremely disorienting.
The Endurance fires retro-thrusters to slow, descending
towards the wormhole ...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is at the controls. Doyle is next to him.
COOPER
Any trick to this?
DOYLE
No one knows.
COOPER
(glances at Doyle)
But the others made it, right?
DOYLE
At least some of them.
COOPER
Thanks for the confidence boost.
Cooper stares down into the vast lens of the wormhole.
Everybody ready to say goodbye to
our solar system?
ROMILLY
(over radio)
To our galaxy ...
Cooper pushes the sticks forward, nosing down and letting
gravity PULL them towards the center of the wormhole ...
57.
EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance reaches the surface of the wormhole. As it
crosses the threshold it becomes apparent that THERE IS NO
SURFACE ... the craft simply passes into the space of the
distortion, its own warped reflection flickering towards it
as if the ship were leaning into a giant shaving mirror ...
INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Doyle stare at the distortion of space ahead ...
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Romilly look out at reflections bordering the bulk
- a space beyond our three dimensions ...
EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance moves through a TUNNEL OF DISTORTED
REFLECTIONS, seeming to gather more and more dizzying speed,
but getting no closer to the far mouth, as if on an
accelerating treadmill -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, awestruck, checks his instruments -
DOYLE
They won’t help you in here. We’re
cutting through the bulk - space
beyond our three dimensions ...
(Checks his equipment.)
All we can do is record and
observe.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand JUMPS - a shape in the air in front of her is BENDING,
warping to form ripples in spacetime inside the cabin -
Romilly STARES at the distortion -
ROMILLY
What is that?!
Brand watches the distortion move towards her -
58.
BRAND
I think - I think it’s them.
ROMILLY
Distorting spacetime? Don’t -!
Brand is reaching out towards the warped space - it MOVES
towards her, DISTORTING her hand - but Brand is not in pain
...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Doyle watch the tunnel mouth STREAK towards them,
a mass of stars and nebulae GROWING ...
EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance slides out of the wormhole.
INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Suddenly, the instruments are chirping -
DOYLE
We’re ... here.
Cooper and Doyle look out at the new galaxy ...
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand’s hand is back to normal. She stares at her fingers.
ROMILLY
What was that?
Brand flexes her fingers, delighted.
BRAND
The first handshake.
EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS
The cosmos is more CROWDED here - STAR upon STAR, NEBULAE
...
59.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
Doyle calls up data on a workstation -
DOYLE
The lost communications came
through -
BRAND
How?
DOYLE
The relay on this side cached them.
Doyle flicks through data -
Years of basic data - no real
surprises. Miller’s site has kept
pinging thumbs up, as has Mann ...
but Edmunds went down, three years
ago.
BRAND
Transmitter failure?
DOYLE
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right till it went dark.
ROMILLY
Miller still looks good?
Doyle nods. Romilly is drawing on a whiteboard -
She’s coming up fast ... with one
complication - the planet is much
closer to Gargantua than we
thought.
COOPER
Gargantua?
DOYLE
A very large black hole. Miller’s
and Dr Mann’s planets orbit it.
BRAND
And Miller’s is on the horizon?
ROMILLY
A basketball around the hoop.
Landing there takes us dangerously
close. A black hole that big has a
huge gravitational pull.
Cooper glances around the concerned faces -
60.
COOPER
Look, I can swing around that
neutron star to decelerate -
BRAND
It’s not that, it’s time. That
gravity will slow our clock
compared to Earth’s. Drastically.
COOPER
How bad?
ROMILLY
Every hour we spend on that planet
will be maybe ... seven years back
on Earth.
COOPER
Jesus -
ROMILLY
That’s relativity, folks.
COOPER
We can’t drop down there without
considering the consequences.
DOYLE
Cooper, we have a mission - COOPER
That’s easy for you to say - you
don’t have anyone back on Earth
waiting for you, do you?
DOYLE
You have no idea what’s easy for
me.
BRAND
Cooper’s right. We have to think of
time as a resource, just like
oxygen and food. Going down there
is going to cost us.
Doyle steps up to the screen, points out three planets.
DOYLE
Look, Dr Mann’s data is promising,
but we won’t get there for months.
Edmunds is even further. Miller
hasn’t sent much, but what she has
sent is promising - water, organics
...
61.
BRAND
You don’t find that every day.
DOYLE No, you do not. So think
about the resources it would take
to come back here ...
They look at each other, considering. Cooper turns to
Romilly -
COOPER
How far off the planet do we have
to stay to be out of the time
shift?
Romilly indicates a spot on his white board.
ROMILLY
Just back from the cusp.
COOPER
So we track a wider orbit of
Gargantua, parallel with Miller’s
planet but a little further out ...
take a Ranger down, grab Miller and
her samples, debrief and analyze
back here
BRAND
That’ll work.
COOPER
No time for monkey business down
there - Tars, you’d better wait up
here. Who else?
ROMILLY
If we’re talking about a couple
years - I’d use that time to work
on gravity - observations from the
wormhole. That’s gold to Professor
Brand.
COOPER
Okay. Tars, factor an orbit of
Gargantua - minimal thrusting -
conserve fuel - but stay in range.
TARS
Don’t worry, I wouldn’t leave you
behind ...
(Swivels around.)
Dr Brand.
She smiles at him.
62.
EXT. BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY
A black sphere sucking light from the cosmos, visible by its
distorting effect on the light of stars behind it - squeezed
into a GLOWING, CURVED HORIZON. The Endurance approaches.
INT. RANGER COCKPIT - DAY
Cooper looks out at Gargantua. Doyle peers over his shoulder
DOYLE
A literal heart of darkness ...
Brand points to a small glowing planet nearer the blackness.
BRAND
There’s Miller’s planet.
Cooper turns to Case, the machine riding shotgun.
COOPER
Ready?
CASE
Yup.
COOPER
Don’t say much, do you?
CASE
Tars talks plenty for both of us.
Cooper chuckles as he throws a final switch -
COOPER
Detach -
EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger DETACHES from the ring module, like an X-1 from a
B-29, FIRES retro-thrusters to slow and ... DROPS -
EXT. THE BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY
The Ranger SHOOTS down towards Gargantua -
63.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is in awe at their acceleration -
COOPER
(into radio)
Romilly, you reading these forces?
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Romilly studies data, marveling.
ROMILLY
Unbelievable.
(Looks out at Gargantua.)
If we could see the collapsed star
inside, the singularity, we’d solve
gravity.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks down at the eerie blackness sliding beneath -
COOPER
No way to get anything from it?
ROMILLY
(over radio)
Nothing escapes that horizon. Not
even light. The answer’s there,
just no way to see it.
EXT. GARGANTUA - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger looks tiny as it STREAKS over the blackness, high
above the GLOWING HORIZON. It is approaching Miller’s
planet, a gleaming dark-blue world ...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper studies his trajectory.
CASE
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Should we use the thrusters to
slow?
64.
COOPER
We’re gonna use the Ranger’s
aerodynamics to save the fuel.
CASE
Air brake?
COOPER
Wanna get in fast, don’t we?
CASE
Brand, Doyle, get ready.
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger STREAKS down towards the planet. It starts to
encounter the STRATOSPHERE -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The craft starts to HOWL and SHAKE. Cooper studies the
curving horizon, concentrating -
CASE
We should ease -
COOPER
Hands where I can see them, Case!
Only time I ever went down was a
machine easing at the wrong moment
-
CASE
A little caution -
COOPER
Can get you killed, same as
reckless.
DOYLE
Cooper! Too damn fast!
COOPER
I got this.
Cooper squeezes the shaking controls with white knuckles -
CASE
Should I disable the feedback?
65.
COOPER
No! No, I need to feel the air ...
EXT. STRATOSPHERE, MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger glows WHITE HOT, slicing through FLAT CLOUDS -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper peers out at the razor-like layers of cloud -
COOPER
Do we have a fix on the beacon?
CASE
Got it. Can you maneuver?
COOPER
Gotta shave more speed. I’ll try
and spiral down on it -
Doyle looks at Brand, nervous. She takes a breath.
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger CUTS through cloud formations, BURSTING out into
CLEARER AIR, HIGH ABOVE AN ENDLESS OCEAN -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The crew peer at SPARKLING WATER, streaking below them -
DOYLE
Just water.
BRAND
The stuff of life ...
CASE
Twelve hundred meters out.
Cooper BANKS sharply, eases down.
BRAND
It’s shallow. Feet deep ...
66.
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger is low now, kicking up backwash -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
CASE
Seven hundred meters ...
Cooper peers ahead -
COOPER
Wait for it ...
CASE
Five hundred meters ...
Cooper YANKS the stick -
COOPER
Fire!
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger’s retro-rockets FIRE - killing the craft’s speed
just feet from the surface. Water SPRAYS UP as the Ranger
SLEWS diagonally, gear is lowered, the Ranger drops, its
landing gear holding it just above the shallow water.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Everyone BOUNCES with the impact. Then BREATHES.
BRAND
Very graceful.
COOPER
No. But it was very efficient.
(Looks at them.)
What’re you waiting for? Go!
Brand and Doyle hurry out of their harnesses, helmets on.
Case moves to the hatch. With a CRACK, the hatch opens and
LIGHT and SPRAY whip inside ...
67.
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
Case climbs quickly from the craft, knee deep in the water.
Brand and Doyle follow. Case TRACKS the beacon.
CASE
This way, about two hundred meters.
Brand and Doyle peer into the distance. Smooth, ankle-deep
water to the horizon, where a distant MOUNTAIN RANGE LOOMS.
They start splashing towards it in their heavy spacesuits
...
DOYLE
(panting)
The gravity’s punishing ...
BRAND
Floating through space too long?
CASE
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper listens to their chatter, IMPATIENT.
COOPER
(under his breath)
Come on ...
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Doyle falls behind. Brand pushes on. Ahead, Case stops.
CASE
Should be here.
Brand joins him, searching the shallows for some sign of
Miller’s mission. She looks up, confused.
BRAND
If the signal’s coming from here -
Case DROPS to his knees THRASHING under the water, like a
bear fishing. Doyle arrives -
DOYLE
What’s he doing?
68.
INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper notices something. In the distance. The mountains -
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Case WRENCHES a piece of DAMAGED EQUIPMENT from the sea bed.
BRAND
Her beacon ...
Case starts lugging the beacon to the Ranger.
DOYLE
Wreckage. Where’s the rest ...?
BRAND
Towards the mountains!
She starts moving fast towards some FLOATING OBJECTS.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is staring out at the horizon -
COOPER
Those aren’t mountains ...
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand pauses -
COOPER
(over radio)
They’re waves -
Brand looks closer - the ’mountains’ are moving, tiny lines
of white sea spray are blowing from the tops ...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks the other direction ... there is a MOUNTAIN
WAVE BEARING DOWN ON THE SHIP ...
69.
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand is searching the wreckage -.
COOPER
(over radio)
Brand, get back here!
BRAND
We need the recorder -
Doyle looks from Brand to Case, who is loading the beacon.
Beyond him Doyle sees the mountain wave approaching -
DOYLE
Case, go get her!
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper hits the dash, frustrated.
COOPER
Dammit! Brand, get back here!
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand sloshes along, checking DEBRIS -
BRAND
We can’t leave without her data -
COOPER
(over radio)
You don’t have time!
Case is back at Doyle.
DOYLE
Go, go!
Case takes off towards Brand, who is trying to lift a piece
of equipment from the water. She drops it and moves on -
EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper swings open the hatch, stands in the doorway, peering
out at the approaching mountain waves - turns back to Brand
-
70.
COOPER
Get back here! Now!
Brand has pulled something heavy from the wreckage - she
SLIPS, the wreckage PINNING her down ... She looks back at
the Ranger - sees the mountain wave THOUSANDS OF FEET HIGH
ALMOST UPON THEM -
BRAND
Cooper, go! Go! I can’t make it!
Cooper looks at Case RACING towards her -
COOPER
Get up, Brand!
BRAND
GO! GET OUT OF HERE!
Case THROWS her onto his back and starts running. Doyle
stands, mesmerized by the sheer liquid mountain face ...
COOPER
Doyle! Come on! Case has her!
Doyle turns, starts sloshing back, the water RUNNING against
his ankles now ... Two hundred yards behind, Case POUNDS
through the shallows, Brand on his back -
Cooper looks up at the EVER CLOSER MOUNTAIN WAVE - jumps
inside.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper powers up, as the wall of liquid fills his view.
COOPER
Come on, come on ...
He sees the water right upon them - RUNS back to the hatch.
Doyle is at the foot of the ladder, Case RUNNING FAST.
DOYLE
Go!
Case JUMPS up the ladder, THROWS Brand inside - TURNS for
Doyle. The Ranger TILTS, RISES - DOYLE IS RIPPED FROM CASE’S
HAND - WATER RAGES ACROSS THE OPEN HATCH -
COOPER
Shut the hatch!
Case shuts the hatch. Cooper is throwing switches -
71.
COOPER
Power down! Power down! We have to
ride it out!
(To Brand, furious.)
We are not prepared for this!
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Doyle is DRAGGED under and away. The Ranger is SUCKED
SIDEWAYS up the face of the mountain -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Cooper are thrown across the cockpit. Case GRABS
Brand, pulls her into her seat - Cooper holds on as the
craft ROLLS and ROLLS -
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger reaches the top of the wave, rocks upright -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper drops into his seat as the water pours off the canopy
-
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger tilts over the backside of the wave, SURFING for
a second then PITCHING FORWARD - TUMBLING DOWN 8,000 FEET
...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
They hang on for dear life, THRASHED MERCILESSLY -
EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger comes AGROUND as the wave leaves it behind ...
72.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The craft comes to rest. Cooper jumps to the controls,
powers up the electrics. The engines won’t respond -
EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The gear LIFTS the Ranger. Water FLOODS out -
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries the engines again. Nothing.
CASE
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
COOPER
(hits console)
GODDAMN!
BRAND
I told you to leave me.
COOPER
And I told you to get your ass back
here! Difference is, only one of us
was thinking about the mission -
BRAND
Cooper, you were thinking about
getting home - I was trying to do
the right thing!
COOPER
Tell that to Doyle.
Quiet. Cooper looks down at the clock. Bitter.
How long to drain, Case?
CASE
Forty-five to an hour.
Cooper shakes his head. Pulls his helmet off.
COOPER
The stuff of life, huh? What’s this
gonna cost us, Brand?
BRAND
A lot. Decades.
Cooper rubs his face. Mind reeling. Trying to breathe.
73.
COOPER
What happened to Miller?
BRAND
Judging by the wreckage, she was
broken up by a wave soon after
impact.
COOPER
How could the wreckage still be
together after all these years?
BRAND
Because of the time slippage. On
this planet’s time, she landed here
just hours ago. She might’ve only
died minutes ago.
Case indicates the beacon.
CASE
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status, echoing
endlessly.
Cooper takes this in. Breathes hard. Takes off his gloves.
COOPER
We’re not prepared for this, Brand.
You’re a bunch of eggheads without
the survival skills of a boy-scout
troop.
BRAND
We got this far on our brains -
farther than any humans in history
-
COOPER
Not far enough. And we’re stuck
here till there won’t be anyone
left on Earth to save -
BRAND
I’m counting every second, same as
you, Cooper.
Cooper takes this in. They’re in the same boat.
COOPER
Don’t you have some clever way we
jump into a black hole and get back
the years?
74.
She shakes her head, dismissive.
COOPER
Don’t just shake your head at me -!
BRAND
Time is relative - it can stretch
and squeeze - but it can’t run
backwards. The only thing that can
move across dimensions like time is
gravity.
COOPER
(thinks)
The beings who led us here ... they
communicate through gravity ...
Brand nods.
Could they be talking to us from
the future?
BRAND
(considers)
Maybe ...
COOPER
Well, if they can -
BRAND
Look, Cooper, they’re creatures of
at least five dimensions - to them
time may be just another physical
dimension. To them the past might
be a canyon they can climb into and
the future a mountain they can can
climb up ... but to us it’s not,
okay?
Brand pulls her helmet off. Looks Cooper in the eyes.
BRAND
I’m sorry, Cooper. I screwed up.
But you knew about relativity.
COOPER
My daughter was ten. I couldn’t
explain Einstein’s theories before
I left.
BRAND
Could you tell her you were going
to save the world?
75.
COOPER
No. I wasn’t much of a parent, but
I understood the most important
thing - let your kids feel safe.
Which rules out telling a
ten-year-old that the world’s
ending.
CASE
Cooper?
Case is pointing out at another MOUNTAIN RANGE.
COOPER
How long for the engines?
CASE
A minute or two -
COOPER
We don’t have it!
The mountain wave is approaching. Cooper tries the engines -
EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
The rockets COUGH and steam ...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper tries the engines again. Close. But no ignition.
COOPER
Helmets on!
The wave is upon them ...
COOPER
Blow our cabin oxygen through the
main thrusters. We’ll spark it -
Case hits a button - a HISS and SHRIEK of gas escaping ...
Brand seals her helmet just as the cockpit DEPRESSURIZES -
COOPER
Come on, now ...
Cooper hits the engines - they BLAST TO LIFE -
76.
EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS
A fiery BLAST sends the Ranger clear of the mountain wave.
Down below, Doyle’s body lies in the shallows, about to be
swept up into the next rush of water ...
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Romilly watches as Cooper and Brand enter the Endurance.
BRAND
Hello, Rom.
ROMILLY
I’ve waited years.
COOPER
How many years?
ROMILLY
By now ... it must be -
TARS
Twenty-three years ...
Cooper’s head lowers.
TARS
... four months, eight days.
Cooper turns away.
ROMILLY
Doyle?
Brand’s eyes flicker down. She shakes her head. She grasps
Romilly’s hands, looks up into his eyes, vulnerable -
BRAND
I thought I was prepared. I knew
all the theory. Reality’s
different.
ROMILLY
And Miller?
BRAND
There’s nothing here for us.
Brand looks at Romilly’s wrinkles. His greying beard.
77.
BRAND
Why didn’t you sleep?
ROMILLY
I did a couple of stretches. But I
stopped believing you were coming
back, and something seems wrong
about dreaming your life away. I
learned what I could from studying
the black hole, but I couldn’t send
anything to your father. We’ve been
receiving, but nothing gets out.
She looks up at Romilly, not wanting to ask ...
BRAND
Is he still alive?
Romilly nods. Brand closes her eyes with relief.
ROMILLY
We’ve got years of messages stored
...
Brand opens her eyes, looks for Cooper. He is in the comm.
booth. He SHUTS the privacy curtain. She looks down.
INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Cooper studies the machine like it might bite him.
COOPER
Cooper.
COMPUTER VOICE
Messages span twenty-three years -
COOPER
I know.
(Whispers.)
Just start at the beginning.
Cooper leans forward as the screen flickers to life: Tom,
still seventeen, turns on the camera.
TOM
Hi, Dad -
Cooper pauses it. Prepares himself. Lets it run -
78.
TOM
I met another girl, Dad. I really
think this is the one -
Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
Murph stole Grandpa’s car. She
crashed it - she’s okay, though.
Your truck’s still running -
Grandpa said she should steal that
next time. I said if she did it’d
be the last thing she did ...
Cooper leans back ...
INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - DAY
Cooper is holed up, still watching, unshaved. He’s been
watching for days. On the screen, Tom is in his twenties -
TOM
I’ve got a surprise for you, Dad.
You’re a grandpa ...
Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling.
Congratulations. Meet Jesse.
Cooper smiles a tearful smile.
Grandpa said he already earned the
’great’ part so we just leave it at
that.
The screen cuts out. Then comes back on. Tom in his thirties
-
Hi, Dad. I’m sorry it’s been
awhile. What with Jesse and all ...
He stops, emotional.
Grandpa died last week. We buried
him out in the back forty, next to
Mom and Jesse.
(Looks down.)
Where we’d have buried you, if
you’d ever come back.
(Looks up.)
Murph was there for the funeral. I
don’t see her so much anymore.
(Sighs.)
You’re not listening to this. I
know that. All these messages are
just out there, drifting in the
darkness ... I figured as long as
they were willing to send them
there was some hope, but ...
79.
(Pauses.)
You’re gone. You’re never coming
back. And I’ve known that for a
long time. Lois says - that’s my
wife, Dad - she says I have to let
you go. So I am.
(Reaches up to turn off
camera.)
Wherever you are, I hope you’re at
peace. Goodbye, Dad.
The screen goes black. Tears are streaming down Cooper’s
face. He stares at the black screen, wiping his face. He
starts to get up - the screen flickers to life once more -
A beautiful WOMAN of about forty has turned on the camera -
she looks at us, unsure about this. Makes a start -
WOMAN
Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
Cooper peers into the face, recognizing -
COOPER
(whispers)
Murph?
WOMAN (MURPH)
I never made one of these when you
were still responding cos I was so
mad at you for leaving. When you
went quiet, it seemed like I should
just live with my decision. And I
have ...
(Looks around.)
But today’s my birthday. And it’s a
special one because you once told
me -
She stops, unable to speak for a second.
MURPH
You once told me that when you came
back we might be the same age ...
and today I’m the age you were when
you left ...
(Starts crying.)
So it’d be a real good time for you
to come back.
Murph reaches up, switches off the camera and we stay with
her in -
80.
INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY
Murph brings her hand down from the camera. Wipes her tears.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(O.S., softly)
I didn’t mean to intrude.
Murph turns to see Professor Brand, now ELDERLY, in a
WHEELCHAIR in the doorway.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’ve never seen you in here before.
Murph rises -
MURPH
I’ve never been in here before.
Murph wheels Professor Brand out into the corridor.
INT. CURVING CORRIDOR, NASA - MOMENTS LATER
Murph pushes Professor Brand.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I talk to Amelia all the time. It
helps. I’m glad you’ve started -
MURPH
I haven’t. I just had something I
wanted to get out.
INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Professor Brand wheels behind his desk.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I know they’re still out there.
MURPH
I know.
PROFESSOR BRAND
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting
through.
MURPH
(smiles gently)
I know, Professor.
81.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m not sure which I’m more afraid
of ... they never come back, or
they come back to find we’ve
failed.
She watches his introspection. Brings him back with -
MURPH
Then let’s succeed.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(gestures at formula)
So, back from the fourth iteration,
let’s run it with a finite set.
Murph has picked up a notebook. Pauses.
MURPH
With respect, Professor. We’ve
tried that hundreds of times.
PROFESSOR BRAND
And it only has to work once,
Murph.
She shrugs. Starts to work.
INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - LATER
Murph and Professor Brand sit, eating sandwiches on a
walkway. WORKERS move about the CIRCULAR CHAMBER, building
more SIDEWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE. Professor Brand looks down,
proud.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Every rivet they drive in could
have been a bullet. We’ve done well
for the world, here. Whether or not
we crack the equation before I kick
-
MURPH
Don’t be morbid, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m not afraid of death, Murph. I’m
an old physicist - I’m afraid of
time.
82.
INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Murph stands before the algebra. She REALIZES something.
MURPH
Time ... you’re afraid of time ...
CONVINCED, she TURNS -
Professor, the equation ...?
He looks up.
For years we’ve tried to solve it
without changing the underlying
assumptions about time -
PROFESSOR BRAND
And?
MURPH
And that means each iteration
becomes an attempt to prove its own
proof - it’s recursive. Nonsensical
-
PROFESSOR BRAND
(sharp)
Are you calling my life’s work
’nonsense’, Murph?
MURPH
No, I’m saying you’ve been trying
to finish it with one arm - no,
with both arms tied behind your
back ...
Murph focuses on Professor Brand, suddenly WARY ...
... and I don’t understand why.
Professor Brand looks down. Starts wheeling his chair.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I’m an old man, Murph. Could we
pick this up some other time? I’d
like to go talk to my daughter.
Murph nods. Looking at the Professor. Confused.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
Stepping out into the universe, we
must first confront the reality
that nothing in our solar system
can help us ...
83.
INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - NIGHT
Brand watches her father on screen.
PROFESSOR BRAND
(V.O.)
... then we must confront the
realities of interstellar travel.
We must venture far beyond the
reach of our own life spans. We
must think not as individuals, but
as a species ...
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Romilly, Brand, Cooper, Tars and Case sit in discussion.
COOPER
Tars kept the Endurance right where
we needed her, but it took years
longer than we anticipated ...
Cooper puts both planets on screen - Dr Mann’s ice world,
and Edmunds’ desert planet.
COOPER
We don’t have the fuel to visit
both prospects. We have to choose.
ROMILLY
How? They’re both promising.
Edmunds’ data was better, but Dr
Mann is the one still transmitting.
BRAND
We’ve got no reason to suppose
Edmunds’ results would have soured.
His world has key elements to
sustain human life -
COOPER
As does Dr Mann’s.
BRAND
Cooper, this is my field. And I
really believe Edmunds’ is the
better prospect.
COOPER
(challenging)
Why?
84.
BRAND
Gargantua, that’s why.
(Steps to board.)
Look at Miller’s world -
hydrocarbons, organics, yes. But no
life. Sterile. We’ll find the same
thing on Dr Mann’s.
ROMILLY
Because of the black hole?
BRAND
(nods)
Murphy’s Law - whatever can happen
will happen. Accident is the first
building block of evolution - but
when you’re orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen - it sucks in
asteroids and comets, random events
that would otherwise reach you. We
need to go to further afield.
COOPER
You once referred to Dr Mann as the
’best of us’.
BRAND
He’s remarkable. We’re only here
because of him.
COOPER
And he’s there on the ground
sending an unambiguous message that
we should go to that planet.
Brand is silent. Romilly looks from Brand to Cooper.
ROMILLY
Should we vote?
COOPER
If we’re going to vote, there’s
something you need to know. Brand?
She says nothing.
He has a right to know.
BRAND
That has nothing to do with it.
ROMILLY
What does?
85.
COOPER
She’s in love with Wolf Edmunds.
ROMILLY
(to Brand)
Is that true?
BRAND
Yes. And that makes me want to
follow my heart. But maybe we’ve
spent too long trying to figure all
this with theory -
COOPER
You’re a scientist, Brand -
BRAND
I am. So listen to me when I tell
you that love isn’t something we
invented - it’s observable,
powerful. Why shouldn’t it mean
something?
COOPER
It means social utility - child
rearing, social bonding -
BRAND
We love people who’ve died ...
where’s the social utility in that?
Maybe it means more - something we
can’t understand, yet. Maybe it’s
some evidence, some artifact of
higher dimensions that we can’t
consciously perceive. I’m drawn
across the universe to someone I
haven’t seen for a decade, who I
know is probably dead. Love is the
one thing we’re capable of
perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space. Maybe
we should trust that, even if we
can’t yet understand it.
Brand looks at Romilly, who can’t meet her eye.
BRAND
Cooper, yes - the tiniest
possibility of seeing Wolf again
excites me. But that doesn’t mean
I’m wrong.
Cooper thinks back to his conversation with Donald.
86.
COOPER
Honestly, Amelia ... it might.
Romilly looks at Brand. It’s clear she’s lost.
COOPER
Tars, set the course for Dr Mann.
Brand is starting to tear up. She turns away.
EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER
The thrusters FIRE, pushing the Endurance out of its orbit
of Gargantua.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER
Brand is checking her POPULATION BOMB. Cooper enters.
COOPER
Brand, I’m sorry.
BRAND
Why? You’re just being objective.
(Beat.)
Unless you’re punishing me for
screwing up on Miller’s planet.
COOPER
This wasn’t a personal decision for
me.
Brand turns from her equipment. Looks him in the eye.
BRAND
Well, if you’re wrong, you’ll have
a very personal decision to make.
(Off look.)
Your fuel calculations are based on
a return journey. Strike out on Dr
Mann’s planet, and we’ll have to
decide whether to return home, or
push on to Edmunds’ planet with
Plan B. Starting a colony could
save us from extinction.
She closes the population bomb.
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again ... and
the future of the human race.
(Smiles bitterly.)
(MORE)
87.
BRAND (cont’d)
I trust you’ll be as objective,
then.
EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS
The Endurance sinks past a GLORIOUS NEBULA whose GOLDEN
MISTS DISSOLVE TO ROILING BLACK CLOUDS and we are -
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph stands with Tom, now late forties. Watching a field
BURN.
TOM
We’ll lose about a third this
season. But next year ... I’m gonna
start working Nelson’s fields.
Should make it up.
MURPH
What happened to Nelson?
Tom glances at her. Don’t ask. Heads for the house.
INT./EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK
Murph at family dinner with Tom, LOIS, and their
six-year-old son COOP.
LOIS
Will you stay the night? We left
your room like it was ...
Murph looks down, awkward ...
MURPH
No, I need to ...
Murph looks upstairs. At Lois.
Too many memories, Lois.
She nods. Coop helps Tom clear. As Coop takes Murph’s plate
he starts COUGHING. Looks up at her, sees her concern,
GRINS.
COOP
The dust.
He and Tom head into the kitchen.
88.
MURPH
I have a friend who should look at
his lungs, Lois.
She nods, is about to speak. Tom sits back down.
Pull back to reveal the glowing windows against the
darkening plain, dust clouds rolling across the horizon ...
INT. CORRIDOR, NASA - NIGHT
Murph hurries down a corridor with a doctor, GETTY.
GETTY
He started asking for you after he
came to, but we couldn’t raise you
-
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NASA - MOMENTS LATER
Murph is at Professor Brand’s bedside. He is hooked up to
machines. Barely breathing.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Murph ... Murph ...
Murph takes his hand with gentle concern.
MURPH
I’m here, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I don’t have much life ...
(Breathes.)
I have to tell you ...
MURPH
Try to take it easy.
PROFESSOR BRAND
All these ... years. All these
people ... counted on me ...
MURPH
It’s okay, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I let you ... all you ... down.
89.
MURPH
No. I’ll finish what you started.
Professor Brand looks up into Murph’s eyes, tears welling.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Murph. Good, good Murph. Such faith
... all these years, I told you to
have faith ... to believe ...
MURPH
I do believe -
PROFESSOR BRAND
I needed you to believe your father
was coming back ...
MURPH
I do, Professor -
PROFESSOR BRAND
Forgive me, Murph ...
MURPH
There’s nothing to forgive.
PROFESSOR BRAND
I lied, Murph. I lied to you ...
Murph looks at Professor Brand, confused.
PROFESSOR BRAND
There’s no reason to come back ...
no way to help us ...
MURPH
But Plan A - all this - all these
people ... the equation!
But Professor Brand slowly shakes his head, tears rolling
down. As Murph tries to comprehend, he settles, DRIFTING.
MURPH
(whispers)
Did he know?
Nothing.
Did my dad know?!
Nothing.
Did he abandon me?!
90.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Do ... not ... go...
She leans in to hear.
PROFESSOR BRAND
Gentle ... into ... into ...
MURPH
NO! NO! Professor, stay! You can’t!
You can’t leave ...
Getty is at her shoulder.
MURPH
You can’t, you can’t, you ...
Getty puts his hand on her shoulder. She sits there. Stuck.
As Professor Brand goes still ...
MURPH
(V.O.)
Dr Brand, I’m sorry to tell you
that your father died today ...
INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY
Murph, controlled anger, sits in front of the camera.
MURPH
He had no pain and was ... at
peace. I’m sorry for your loss.
She reaches to switch off the camera. STOPS. Acid.
Did you know, Brand? Did he tell
you ...?
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY
Murph’s voice rings through the empty ship. Only Case there
to register it.
MURPH
(V.O.)
Did you know that Plan A was a sham
...?! You left us here. To die.
Never coming back ...
Through the window we see the Ranger moving away, towards -
91.
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
The Endurance orbits the silvery white globe as the Ranger
heads towards the planet.
EXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER
The Ranger drops through layers of large, MOUNTAINOUS CLOUD.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Tars, Brand and Romilly. Cooper peers out,
concerned, studying a heads-up display of CLOUD DENSITY ...
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger cuts through one cloud, banks left and SCRAPES
AGAINST THE NEXT ’CLOUD’, PANELS TEARING FROM THE WING - THE
CLOUDS ARE ACTUALLY SOLID ICE FORMATIONS ...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper banks away from the ICE, glancing out at the damage -
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger moves cautiously through the ’cloudscape’ like a
ship through an ice field ...
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Romilly and Brand put their helmets on. Tars indicates the
beacon’s position. Cooper looks, BANKS the Ranger.
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
The Ranger’s gear lowers as it comes to rest, tentatively,
at the base of what looks like a large CUMULUS CLOUD.
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER
Cooper leads them up the ICE CLOUD. From a distance, they
are walking on a cloud. Tars brings up the rear.
Cooper crests a ridge. SPOTS something. He starts down
towards a dirty orange dot in the cloudscape.
92.
EXT. DR MANN’S POD - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper is there. The others arrive at the large metal pod -
WEATHERED and DAMAGED over the years, half buried in ice.
Nearby, various WIRE MARKERS stick out of the ice. Tars
starts digging out the hatch.
INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER
A CRACK of COLD LIGHT, as the outer hatch is wrenched open.
Cooper steps through the airlock, into a CRYPT-LIKE SPACE -
Cooper’s hand sweeps ice from the nameplate of a
cryo-chamber, ’DR MANN’.
Tars fires up the cryo-chamber. The ice starts to melt.
Cooper, helmet off, CRACKS the lid, pushes it back,
revealing a figure in a plastic shroud. Cooper rips the seal
...
Dr Mann’s eyes flicker open. He watches Cooper, breathing,
focusing - reaches up with TREMBLING hands - GRABS Cooper -
PULLS himself up, CHEEK AGAINST CHEEK - SOBBING - hands
desperately CARESSING Cooper’s face. Cooper holds him tight.
COOPER
(whispering)
It’s okay. It’s okay.
INT. SAME - LATER
Dr Mann sits, blanket over his shoulders, sipping from a
steaming cup. He looks at their faces, marveling.
DR MANN
(cracked, parched)
Pray you never learn just how good
it can be to see another face.
(Shaky sip.)
I hadn’t much hope to begin with.
After so much time, I had none. My
supplies were exhausted. The last
time I went to sleep, I set no
waking date.
(Looks at them all.)
You have literally raised me from
the dead.
93.
COOPER
(smiles)
Lazarus.
DR MANN
(nods)
And the others?
ROMILLY
I’m afraid you’re it, sir.
DR MANN
So far, surely?
COOPER
With our situation, there’s not
much hope of any other rescue.
This hits Dr Mann hard. He looks down at his tea.
BRAND
Dr Mann, tell us about your world.
DR MANN
(smiles gently)
My world. Yes. Our world, we hope.
Our world is cold, stark ...
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Dr Mann leads the others up to the summit of a cloud.
DR MANN
(V.O.)
But undeniably beautiful ...
From the top, they watch the planet’s pale sun setting.
DR MANN
The days are sixty-seven cold
hours, the nights are sixty-seven
far colder hours ...
They make their way back into the shelter.
DR MANN
(V.O.)
The gravity is a very pleasant 80
percent of Earth’s. Up here, where
I landed, the ’water’ is alkali and
the ’air’ has too much ammonia in
it to breathe for more than a few
minutes ...
94.
Brand checks readings on Dr Mann’s instruments.
INT. DR MANN’S POD - NIGHT
The crew are captivated by Dr Mann ...
DR MANN
But down at the surface, and there
is a surface ... the chlorine
dissipates and the ammonia gives
way to crystalline hydrocarbons and
breathable air. To organics.
Possibly even to life.
(Off looks.)
Yes. We may be sharing this world.
BRAND
(giddy)
These readings are from the
surface?
Brand is reviewing Dr Mann’s piles of data.
DR MANN
Over the years I’ve dropped various
probes.
COOPER
How far have you explored?
DR MANN
I’ve mounted several major
expeditions, but with oxygen in
limited supply, Kipp there had to
do most of the legwork.
Dr Mann indicates a DEFUNCT ARTICULATED MACHINE.
TARS
What’s wrong with him?
DR MANN
Degeneration. He misidentified the
first organics we found as ammonia
crystals. We struggled on for a
time, but ultimately, I
decommissioned him and used his
power source to keep the mission
going.
(Remembers, sadly.)
I thought I was alone before I shut
him down.
95.
TARS
Would you like me to look at him?
DR MANN
No, I think he needs a human touch.
Tars turns to Brand.
TARS
Dr Brand, Case is relaying a
message for you from the comm.
station.
She nods.
MURPH
(V.O.)
... He had no pain and was ... at
peace.
INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER
Brand watches Murph’s message on Tars’ data screen.
MURPH
I’m sorry for your loss.
Brand STARES. Cooper is there. Murph reaches up -
BRAND
(abstract)
Is that Murph?
Cooper nods.
She’s become a -
MURPH
(acid)
Did you know, Brand? Did he tell
you? That Plan A was a sham ...?!
Cooper looks at Brand, who is shocked.
You left us here to set up your
colony. Never coming back ...
Murph does not want to ask, tears are running down her
cheeks -
(Small.)
Did my father know? Dad ...?
Cooper stares. Murph’s eyes bore into his ...
Did you leave me here to die?
96.
The screen goes dark. Cooper stands there, SHOCKED.
BRAND
Cooper, my father devoted his whole
life to Plan A - I have no idea
what she means -
DR MANN
(O.S.)
I do.
They turn. Dr Mann looks at them with gentle calm.
COOPER
He never even hoped to get people
off the Earth.
DR MANN
No.
BRAND
But he’s been trying to solve the
gravity equation for forty years!
Dr Mann comes over, looks into Brand’s eyes.
DR MANN
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.
BRAND
Then why wouldn’t he use it?!
DR MANN
The equation couldn’t reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics.
You need more -
COOPER
More what?!
DR MANN
More data. You need to see inside a
black hole. And the laws of nature
prohibit a naked singularity.
COOPER
(to Romilly)
Is that true?
ROMILLY
If a black hole is an oyster, the
singularity is the pearl inside.
(MORE)
97.
ROMILLY (cont’d)
Its gravity is so strong, it’s
always hidden in darkness, behind
the horizon. That’s why we call it
a black hole.
COOPER
If we could look beyond the horizon
-
DR MANN
Some things aren’t meant to be
known.
(To Brand.)
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from
extinction. Plan B. A colony.
BRAND
Why not tell people? Why keep
building that damn station?
DR MANN
He knew how much harder it would be
for people to come together and
save the species, instead of
themselves ...
(To Cooper, sympathetic.)
Or their children.
COOPER
Bullshit.
DR MANN
Would you have left if you hadn’t
believed you were trying to save
them? Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier - we
can care deeply, selflessly for
people we know, but our empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of
sight.
BRAND
But the lie. A monstrous lie ...
DR MANN
Unforgivable. And he knew it. Your
father was prepared to destroy his
own humanity to save our species.
He made the ultimate sacrifice.
98.
COOPER
No. That’s being made by the people
of Earth who’ll die because, in his
arrogance, he declared their case
hopeless.
DR MANN
I’m sorry, Cooper. Their case is
hopeless. We are the future.
Cooper REELS. Brand puts her hand on his shoulder -
BRAND
Cooper, what can I do?
He turns to her. Looks her in the eyes.
COOPER
Let me go home.
And the sound of WIND in DRY CORNSTALKS takes us -
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAWN
Murph drives. Getty next to her. In the distance, several
fields BURN.
GETTY
Are you sure?
MURPH
His solution was correct. He’d had
it for years.
GETTY
It’s worthless?
MURPH
It’s half the answer.
GETTY
How do you find the other half?
Murph points at the sky.
MURPH
Out there? A black hole. Stuck here
on Earth? I’m not sure you can.
They pass vehicles PILED HIGH with belongings and people.
99.
GETTY
They just pack up and leave. What
are they hoping to find?
MURPH
Survival.
(Looks ahead.)
Dammit!
A DUST STORM SWAMPS the truck, killing visibility. Murph
pulls over. Kills the engine. The wind rocks the car.
GETTY
Don’t people have a right to know?
MURPH
Panic won’t help. We have to keep
working, same as ever.
GETTY
Isn’t that just what Professor
Brand ...?
MURPH
(sharp)
Brand gave up on us - I’m still
trying to solve this.
GETTY
So you have an idea?
MURPH
No. I have a ... feeling.
Getty looks at her as she STARES out at the dust.
INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN), wet hair, towel around neck, turns
and STARES at a book on the floor -
MURPH
(V.O.)
I told you about my ghost ...
She stoops to pick up the toy next to it - a broken LUNAR
LANDER.
MURPH (FORTY) puts her hands on the glass, watching the sand
scrape the car’s window ...
MURPH
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it ...
100.
INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN) counts the books and gaps.
MARVELING.
MURPH
(V.O.)
But I was never scared of it ...
MURPH (TEN) takes out her notebook and starts drawing lines
to represent the books.
MURPH
(V.O.)
I called it a ghost because it felt
like ...
MURPH (FORTY) turns to Getty.
MURPH
Like a person. Trying to tell me
something ...
The storm is clearing. Murph starts the engine.
If there’s an answer here on Earth,
it’s back there, somehow. No one’s
coming to save us.
(Pulls out.)
I have to find it ...
Murph pulls past a pickup piled with worldly goods and
people. She makes eye contact with two filthy kids in the
back ...
And we’re running out of time.
EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAWN
Tars is up on the wing of the Ranger. Case pilots the LANDER
in to land near the Ranger.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS
Cooper is sitting with his feet on the console.
CASE
(over radio)
What about auxiliary oxygen
scrubbers?
COOPER
They can stay. I’ll sleep most of
the journey.
(Wry.)
(MORE)
101.
COOPER (cont’d)
I saw it all on the way out here.
Romilly comes through the airlock. Removes his helmet.
ROMILLY
I have a suggestion for your return
journey.
COOPER
What?
ROMILLY
Have one last crack at the black
hole ...
Tars enters.
ROMILLY
Gargantua’s an older, spinning
black hole - what we call a gentle
singularity.
COOPER
Gentle?
ROMILLY
They’re hardly gentle, but their
tidal gravity is quick enough that
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive ... a probe, say.
COOPER
What happens to it after it
crosses?
ROMILLY
Beyond the horizon is a complete
mystery - who’s to say there isn’t
some way the probe can glimpse the
singularity and relay the quantum
data? If he’s equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse
- X-ray, visible light, radio -
TARS
Just when did this probe become a
’he’?
Romilly looks from Tars to Cooper, sheepish.
102.
ROMILLY
Tars is the obvious candidate. I’ve
already told him what to look for.
TARS
I’d need to take the old optical
transmitter from Kipp.
COOPER
(to Tars)
You’d do this for us?
TARS
Before you get teary, try to
remember that as a robot I have to
do anything you say, anyway.
COOPER
Your cue light’s broken.
TARS
I’m not joking.
Bing. The light flashes on.
EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Brand and Dr Mann approach Cooper and Romilly at the foot of
the ladder. Cooper addresses Brand -
COOPER
Ranger’s almost ready. Case is on
his way back down with another
load.
BRAND
I’ll start a final inventory.
ROMILLY
Dr Mann, I need Tars to remove and
adapt some components from Kipp.
Dr Mann considers this. Looks at Tars. At Romilly.
DR MANN
He musn’t disturb Kipp’s archival
functions.
ROMILLY
I’ll supervise.
Dr Mann considers this. Nods.
103.
COOPER
We need to pick out a site. You
don’t wanna move the module once we
land it.
DR MANN
I’ll show you the probe sites.
Cooper glances around at the winds picking up -
COOPER
Will conditions hold?
DR MANN
These squalls usually blow over.
You’ve got a long-range
transmitter?
Cooper reaches up to check a box plugged in at his neck.
COOPER
Good to go.
Dr Mann points at a nozzle on his elbow -
DR MANN
Charged?
Cooper checks, thumbs up. Dr Mann sets off, Cooper follows.
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER
As Cooper follows Dr Mann down a ridge, they see the lander
fly over. Cooper waves, reaches up to his long-range
transmitter -
COOPER
A little caution, Case?
CASE
(over radio)
Safety first, Cooper.
Cooper follows Dr Mann down to the edge of the ice. They
peer down a fifty-foot drop.
DR MANN
Just take it gently -
He steps off, DROPPING - his ELBOW JETS FIRE, slowing his
descent in time for him to land with a THUD. Cooper follows.
They set out through a massive CANYON of ice ...
104.
DR MANN
Brand told me why you feel you have
to go back -
Cooper STOPS.
COOPER
If this excursion is about trying
to change my mind, let’s turn
around right now.
DR MANN
No. I understand your position.
He turns and starts walking. Cooper follows.
DR MANN
You have attachments. I’m not
supposed to, but even without
family, I can promise you that the
yearning to be with other people is
massively powerful. Our instincts,
our emotions, are at the
foundations of what makes us human.
They’re not to be taken lightly.
The wind WHIPS ice crystals between them ...
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph introduces Getty to Lois and Coop. Getty pulls out a
STETHOSCOPE and starts examining Coop, Murph slips upstairs
...
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - DAY
Murph opens the door. Stands in her old bedroom. Feeling ...
COOP
(O.S.)
Mama lets me play in here ...
Murph turns to see Coop. He points at a box on the shelf -
I don’t touch your stuff.
105.
EXT. LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Brand turns away as the lander touches down in a spray of
ice.
INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS
Romilly watches Tars crouch down beside Kipp and connect
Kipp to his own power. Kipp shows signs of life ...
EXT. ICE CANYON, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Dr Mann waits for Cooper catch up. The WIND is picking up -
DR MANN
You know why we couldn’t just send
machines on these missions, Cooper?
COOPER
(breathless)
Frankly, no.
DR MANN
(pressing on)
A trip into the unknown requires
improvisation. Machines can’t
improvise well because you can’t
program a fear of death. The
survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.
Dr Mann pauses to take a breath. Turns to Cooper.
Take you - a father. With a
survival instinct that extends to
your kids ...
COOPER
That’s why I’m going home, hopeless
or not.
DR MANN
And what does research tell us is
the last thing you’ll see before
you die?
(Off look.)
Your children. At the very moment
of death, your mind pushes you a
little harder to survive. For them.
Dr Mann turns and starts walking out onto a massive ice
field.
106.
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph brings Coop downstairs. Getty is listening to Lois’
back. He looks up at Murph. GRAVE. Shakes his head ...
GETTY
They can’t stay here.
TOM
(O.S.)
Murph?
Murph turns to see Tom in the doorway.
What is this ...?
EXT. LANDER, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Brand is counting flight cases when a WIND whips ice at her
...
INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS
Romilly takes his helmet off, PEERING over Tars’ shoulder at
Kipp’s data screen. Confused.
ROMILLY
I don’t understand.
EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS
Cooper and Dr Mann are like two ants on a sheet.
DR MANN
The first window’s up ahead -
Cooper peers ahead to an OPENING in the ice. Dr Mann stops
at the edge. Looks around the wind-blasted ice plane.
When I left Earth I felt fully
prepared to die. But I just never
faced the possibility that my
planet wouldn’t be the one. None of
this turned out the way it was
supposed to.
COOPER
Professor Brand would disagree.
Cooper peers over the edge at an enormous CREVASSE ...
Dr Mann RIPS COOPER’S LONG-RANGE TRANSMITTER FROM HIS NECK -
107.
Cooper TURNS to Dr Mann - who BLASTS him with his ELBOW JET.
He SLIPS backwards, but avoids going over the edge -
COOPER
What are you doing?!
Until Dr Mann KICKS him. Cooper hits his jets, pushing
himself onto a lower ledge of ice -
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Tom confronts Murph while Getty looks on -
MURPH
They can’t stay here, Tom!
GETTY
Not one more day -
Tom TURNS, PUNCHES Getty - who collapses.
LOIS
Tom?!
TOM
Coop, get your aunt’s things -
she’s done here.
MURPH
Tom, Dad didn’t raise you this dumb
-
TOM
Dad didn’t raise us, Grandpa did,
and he’s buried outside with Mom in
our ground. I’m not leaving them -
MURPH
You have to, Tom -
TOM
I’m a farmer, Murph! You don’t give
up on the Earth.
MURPH
No! But she gave up on you! And
she’s poisoning your family.
108.
EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Cooper SCRAMBLES to his knees. Dr Mann approaches -
DR MANN
I’m sorry - I can’t let you leave.
COOPER
Why?!
DR MANN
We’re going to need your ship to
continue the mission ... once the
others realize what this place
isn’t.
Cooper’s mind races. He looks around.
COOPER
You faked all the data?
DR MANN
I had a lot of time.
COOPER
Is there even a surface?
DR MANN
I’m afraid not -
Dr Mann KICKS Cooper over the edge, Cooper CLINGS on -
DR MANN
I tried to do my duty, Cooper, but
the day I arrived I could see this
place had nothing. I resisted the
temptation for years ... but I knew
there was a way to get rescued.
COOPER
You fucking coward.
Cooper BLASTS Dr Mann off his feet with his jet - SCRAMBLES
up onto the ice. Dr Mann TACKLES him, they go down,
WRESTLING. WIDER shows us two TINY FIGURES in a VAST
LANDSCAPE, deciding the future of humanity with a BRAWL ...
109.
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY
Murph begs Tom -
MURPH
Please, come with us.
TOM
To live underground, praying Dad
comes back to save us all?
MURPH
He’s not coming back. He was never
coming back. It’s up to us. To me.
TOM
You’re gonna save the human race,
Murph? Really? How? Our dad
couldn’t -
MURPH
HE DIDN’T EVEN TRY!
(Off look.)
He just abandoned us, Tom.
Murph looks around, frustrated. Coop hands Murph the box.
MURPH
Tom, if you won’t come, let them -
TOM
Murph.
(Points at box.)
Take your stuff, and go. Murph
hands the box back to Coop.
MURPH
Keep it.
She leaves. Getty follows.
EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Dr Mann LUNGES at Cooper, who SIDESTEPS him and PINS him ...
COOPER
Stop this!
Dr Mann HEADBUTTS COOPER, FACEPLATE IMPACTS FACEPLATE.
110.
COOPER
Mann! Don’t - you’ll kill us both -
CRACK. Dr Mann SMASHES his helmet into Cooper’s AGAIN AND
AGAIN as he -
DR MANN
SOMEONE’S - GLASS - WILL - GIVE -
WAY - FIRST -!
COOPER
FIFTY-FIFTY YOU KILL YOUR SELF!
STOP!
Dr Mann STOPS. Looks up at Cooper, BREATHING. Both
faceplates have TINY FRACTURES ...
DR MANN
Best odds I’ve had in years -
WHACK - He BUTTS Cooper’s faceplate, which CRACKS
SICKENINGLY. AMMONIA HISSES INSIDE - COOPER ROLLS OFF, HANDS
UP, DESPERATELY TRYING TO PLUG THE LARGE CRACK -
Dr Mann RISES. Checks the fractures in his own helmet. Bends
down to look at Cooper, STRUGGLING, CHOKING -
DR MANN
Please don’t judge me, Cooper - you
were never tested like I was. Few
men have been ...
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAY
Murph drives. Getty looks over, sympathetic.
GETTY
You did your best, Murph.
She just stares ahead at the road ...
EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
With curiosity and FEAR, Dr Mann watches Cooper CRAWL ...
DR MANN
You’re feeling it, aren’t you? That
survival instinct - that’s what
drove me. It’s always driven the
human race, and it’s going to save
it now. I’m going to save it. For
all mankind. For you, Cooper.
111.
Unable to watch any more, he RISES, walking away, continuing
to talk to Cooper via the radio ...
DR MANN
I’m sorry, I can’t watch you go
through this - I thought I could.
But I’m still here. I’m here for
you ...
Dr Mann, hurrying away, listens to Cooper RASPING -
DR MANN
Cooper. When you left, did
Professor Brand read you that poem?
How does it end ...?
Dr Mann hauls himself up a ledge. The wind WHIPS up ice.
DR MANN
(over radio)
’Do not go gentle ...’
Cooper FREEZES. REMEMBERS. TRANSMITTER ...

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY
Cooper CRAWLS - CRAWLS - CHOKING - CRAWLING ...
Dr Mann leap/jets up onto the higher ice - glances back at
the floundering figure on the ice with pity and awe.
DR MANN
(whispers)
Cooper ...? Do you see your
children, yet?
112.
Dr Mann hears only CHOKING, GASPING, HACKING. He kills his
radio. Scared. Watches Cooper’s silent thrashing. TURNS.
Cooper GRABS the transmitter - tries to calm his FRANTIC
HANDS - can’t reconnect it with clumsy gloves - pulls glove
off - FREEZING - BITING - WAKING - he gets the connector IN

Through WATERING EYES and WIND-WHIPPED ICE, Cooper glimpses
Brand LEAPING from the lander, elbow jets firing. Brand RIPS
Cooper’s helmet off - THRUSTS an OXYGEN MASK over his nose

Tars turns back from Kipp.
TARS
It needs a person to unlock its

Tars makes way for Romilly, who leans in to the screen. He
glances at his helmet - the radio is SQUAWKING. As he
reaches for his helmet, he places his hand on the screen -
Kipp FLICKERS TO LIFE ... Romilly lifts his helmet -

Cooper pulls back on the sticks, RELIEF washing over him.
Brand comes to ... Cooper turns to Case, grinning -
COOPER
Right? And for our next trick ...
CASE
It’ll have to be good. We’re
heading into Gargantua’s pull -
Cooper’s smile fades. He UNBUCKLES -
COOPER
Take her -
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
HISSING STEAM - RUSHING AIR - WHIRLING DEBRIS as Tars and
Cooper (in suit and helmet) lock down different BULKHEADS -
Brand (in suit and helmet) FLOATS alongside the POPULATION
BOMB, checking the equipment -
CASE
(over radio)
Cooper, we’re slipping towards
Gargantua - shall I use main
engines?
127.
COOPER
No! Let her slide as long as we can
-
Cooper FLIES over to Tars, who is welding a bulkhead -
COOPER
Give it to me.
TARS
There’s good news and bad news -
COOPER
I’ve heard that one, Tars - just
give it to me straight.
INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER
Cooper SCRAMBLES to where Brand is checking her equipment.
COOPER
The navigation mainframe’s
destroyed and we don’t have enough
life support to make it back to
Earth. But we might scrape to
Edmunds’ planet.
BRAND
What about fuel?
COOPER
Not enough. But I’ve got a plan -
let Gargantua suck us right to her
horizon - then a powered slingshot
around to launch us at Edmunds.
BRAND
Manually?
COOPER
That’s what I’m here for. I’ll take
us just inside the critical orbit.
BRAND
And the time slippage?
COOPER
Neither of us can afford to worry
about relativity right now.
128.
BRAND
I’m sorry, Cooper.
They embrace, delicately touching faceplate to faceplate.

The CRIPPLED Endurance FALLS towards the HEART OF DARKNESS
among the stars ...
INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - DAY
Cooper looks ahead at Gargantua. Preparing for battle.
EXT. ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER
The lander DETACHES, shifting its orientation ...
COOPER
(over radio)
Once we’ve gathered enough speed
around Gargantua - we use the
lander 1 Ranger 2 as
rocket-boosters to push us out of
the black hole’s gravity ...
The lander REATTACHES to the rear of the ring module.
INT. COCKPIT, RANGER 2 - CONTINUOUS
Cooper slides into Ranger 2 - checking the systems.
COOPER
The linkages between landers are
destroyed ...
INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS
Tars sits at the controls, running similar checks ...
COOPER
(over radio)
So we’ll control manually. When
Lander 1’s spent, Tars will detach
...
129.
TARS
And get sucked into that black
hole.
INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS
Brand and Case listen to Cooper and Tars over the radio.
BRAND
Why does he have to detach?
COOPER
(over radio)
We have to shed mass if we’re gonna
escape that gravity.
TARS
(over radio)
Newton’s third law - the only way
humans have ever figured out of
getting somewhere is to leave
something behind.

Cooper, you can’t ask Tars to do
this for us -

Come on, Murph! We don’t have much
time!
EXT. GARGANTUA - DAY
A BLACK DOT appears, RUSHING TOWARDS US to become - A DARK
SPHERE - we PLUNGE through it into SILENT DARKNESS - a WHITE
SPHERE races towards us -
Just as the wormhole was a spherical hole, THESE SPHERES ARE
HOLES WITHIN HOLES ... we are dropping through A
FOUR-DIMENSIONAL RABBIT HOLE -
LIGHT/DARK/LIGHT/DARK/LIGHT/DARK with BLINDING RAPIDITY -

Cooper is LAUNCHED out of Ranger 2, which EXPLODES, and,
PULLED to one side, MISSES A WHITE HOLE - PLUNGING INSTEAD
TOWARDS A SMALLER GLASS-LIKE SPHERE -
Cooper slows as he falls towards this sphere, reminiscent of
the wormhole, but the light within is not stars but an
infinity of WORLD LINES - (paths of objects through
spacetime) -
Cooper PLUNGES INTO THE WORLD SPHERE ... As he falls his
SINGLE WORLD LINE stretches behind him - the INFINITE
FUTURES OF HIS WORLD LINE splitting ahead to all the
different possibilities in spacetime -
Cooper himself is now like a ring being pulled down a cone
of fabric. He STARES at the ORDERED CHAOS of world lines ...
As he SLOWS his past and future world lines BREAK UP so they
become like INFINITE REFLECTIONS IN PARALLEL MIRRORS ...
Cooper’s world line DROPS into a SMALL, SQUARE TUNNEL -
INT. THE TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Tight enough to feel BLINDINGLY FAST at first, but Cooper
(and his INFINITE OTHERS) is actually SLOWING ... Cooper
DESPERATELY reaches out, KNOCKING the sides of the tunnel,
TRYING to slow himself - GRAPPLING - KICKING ’BRICKS’ out of
138.
the ’walls’. He finally STOPS. Looks around in the SUDDEN
CALM, FLOATING, catching his breath. He reaches out to the
tunnel wall - CONFUSED -
Each ’brick’ is TIGHTLY PACKED PAPER ... PAGES ... BOOKS -
AS SEEN FROM BEHIND A SHELF ...
Cooper PUSHES against a book - it MOVES SLIGHTLY. Cooper
PUSHES, HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER -
The book drops out of sight, revealing -
Murph, aged ten, wet hair, towel around her neck, TURNS,
STARTLED by THE BOOK FALLING FROM HER SHELF.
COOPER
Murph? Murph?
She can’t hear him ...

Cooper watches Murph (ten) examine the two pieces of the
LUNAR LANDER MODEL -
COOPER
MURPH! MURPH!
She turns ... leaves the room ... Cooper floats there,
staring. He LOOKS around - each ’wall’ of the tesseract is a
different view of Murph’s bedroom, so that by rotating he
can effectively orbit her room ...
He claws his way down to the next book wall. PUNCHES out two
books -
Murph’s bedroom, empty. The door opens, Cooper’s EARLIER
SELF is standing there, staring at the room, perturbed.
Murph (ten) joins Cooper, staring at the empty room ...
Cooper LASHES out at the books - kicks a book out - SPOTS -
Murph (ten) closes her door, crying, sliding the desk in
front -
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) feels the desk. She puts her hand on the back

Cooper, the frustrated observer, spins around to see his
EARLIER SELF nudging the door -

Don’t leave your kids. You goddamn
fool.
Cooper PUNCHES OUT books with all his strength -

S ... T ...
Murph (ten) is watching, no longer scared, fascinated -
COOPER
A ... Y ...
Cooper STOPS. Catches his breath. Waits ...
Earlier Cooper lifts the chair off the table to enter.
Cooper watches his earlier self, FRUSTRATED -
COOPER
Stay, you idiot! Tell him, Murph!
Stay ...
As before, Cooper gives Murph the WATCH ... Murph THROWS THE
WATCH and TURNS AWAY ...
COOPER
Murph, tell him again! Don’t let
him leave ...!
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) picks up the notebook. Opens it. Finds the
word ’STAY’ ... looks up at the books, REALIZING ...

INT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper is crying with frustration ...
COOPER
Murph, don’t let me leave ...
Cooper watches as his earlier self heads to the door -
COOPER
STAY!!
Cooper SMASHES a book from the shelf with all his might -
His earlier self turns back. Looks at the book. Then leaves.
Cooper rests his head against the books, SOBBING.
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) lowers her notebook, moves to the bookshelves,
IN AWE ...
MURPH
Dad ... it was you. You were my
ghost ...
She is crying. Joyful.
INT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper sobs at the back of the books. Lost ...
TARS

Cooper?
Cooper, STARTLED, turns. Tars is not there.
COOPER
You survived.
TARS

Somewhere. In their fifth
dimension. They saved us ...
COOPER
(frustrated)
Who’s ’They’? And why would they
help us?
142.
TARS
(over radio)
I don’t know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space inside
their five-dimensional reality to
allow you to understand it ...
COOPER
It isn’t working -!
TARS
(over radio)
Yes, it is. You’ve seen that time
is represented here as a physical
dimension - you even worked out
that you can exert a force across
spacetime -
COOPER
(realizing)
Gravity. To send a message ...
Cooper looks around the infinite tunnel, infinite Coopers.
COOPER
Gravity crosses the dimensions -
including time -
Cooper THINKS ... He pulls himself up to a different wall,
starts counting books ...
And you have the quantum data, now
-
TARS
(over radio)
I’m transmitting it on all
wavelengths - but nothing’s getting
out ...
COOPER
I can do it -
Cooper HITS a book’s world line, sending a WAVE ...
TARS

Such complicated data ... to a
child ...
COOPER
Not just any child.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) stands there, looking at her old notebook -
the page that says ’STAY’ ...
GETTY

MURPH?! COME ON!
She looks around the room, SEARCHING for an answer ...
EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper watches Murph (ten) looking out the window ...
TARS
(over radio)
Even if you communicate it here,
she wouldn’t understand its
significance for years ...
Cooper is seized by a sudden anger -
COOPER
Then figure something out!
Everybody on Earth is going to die!
TARS
Cooper, they didn’t bring us here
to change the past.
Cooper hears something in this -
COOPER
We brought ourselves here ...
Cooper PUSHES off, looking through the gaps in the books.
Murph’s bedroom, full of DUST in the DUST STORM -
COOPER
Tars, feed me the coordinates of
NASA in binary ...
Cooper is in the room now, drawing a pattern in the dust ...
Cooper watches Murph (ten) burst into the room. Murph stops
and stares at the dust as Cooper’s Earlier Self comes in
past her, SLAMS the window shut - sees the PATTERN of dust
...
144.
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) runs her finger along the DUST of the
windowsill ... She turns to look around the room.
Frustrated.
MURPH
Come on, Dad. Is there something
else here ...?
INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks up from the floor -
COOPER
Don’t you see, Tars? I brought
myself here. We’re here to
communicate with the
three-dimensional world. We’re the
bridge ...
Cooper moves to another iteration of Murph’s room. Murph
(ten) JUMPS up - GRABS the WATCH, RUNS out the door ...
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) looks at the watch, remembering. The second
hand TWITCHES. She drops the watch back into the box ...
INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper pushes himself along the world line of the books ...
COOPER
I thought they chose me - they
never chose me - they chose Murph.
TARS

For what?
COOPER
To save the world!
Murph (ten) comes back into her bedroom, SOBBING. She is
holding the watch. She puts it on the shelf.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) puts the box back on the shelf. SIGHS ...
INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper races FASTER and FASTER down the world lines.
COOPER
’They’ have access to infinite
time, infinite space ...
Cooper gestures at the INFINITIES in all directions ...
COOPER
But no way to find what they need -
but I can find Murph and find a way
to tell her - like I found this
moment -
TARS
(over radio)
How?
COOPER
Love, Tars. Love - just like Brand
said - that’s how we find things
here.
TARS
(over radio)
So what are we here to do?
Cooper looks around the tesseract. The watch sits there on
the shelf for as long as he can see ...
COOPER
The watch. That’s it. She’ll come
back for it -
TARS
How do you know?
COOPER
Because I gave it to her. We use
the second hand. Translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me -
Tars starts to transmit. Cooper GRABS the second-hand world
line - starts to MANIPULATE it, sending waves down the world
line ...
146.
TARS
What if she never came back for it?
COOPER
She will. She will ... I feel it
...
The second hand is FLICKING back and forth ...
INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
Murph (forty) turns to leave ...

Getty is holding a tire iron, watching TOM’S TRUCK APPROACH.
Lois and Coop STARE, FEARFUL, from the truck ...
Tom APPROACHES, BLACK from soot ...
Murph BURSTS out of the house ... right up to Tom ...
MURPH
Tom, he came back ... he came back

TOM
Who?
She holds up the watch ...
MURPH
Dad. It was him. All this time ...
it was him. He’s going to save us

Murph runs to the railing of the catwalk above the enormous
construction, looks down at the thousands of workers below.
Getty comes out after her, curious. She looks at him, then
SHOUTS OUT to the enormous space ...
MURPH
EU-RE-KA!
She turns to Getty - GRINNING.
Well, it’s traditional.
She THROWS her paper out over the railing -
EUREKA!!
Workers look up to see her papers flitting down ...
EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY
Cooper looks out at the world line of the watch, of Murph,
as it leads out into infinite complexity ...
COOPER
Did it work?
TARS
(over radio)
I think it might have.
COOPER
(hopeful)
Why?
TARS
(over radio)
Because the bulk beings are closing
the tesseract ...
148.
Cooper looks out to the distance - it is RAPIDLY
APPROACHING, WORLD LINES BECOMING WORLD SHEETS, BECOMING
BULKS ...
COOPER
Don’t you get it, yet, Tars? ’They’
aren’t ’beings’ ... they’re us ...
trying to help ... just like I
tried to help Murph ...
TARS
(over radio)
People didn’t build this tesseract
-
COOPER
Not yet ... but one day. Not you
and me but people, people who’ve
evolved beyond the four dimensions
we know ...
The tesseract EXPANSION BACK INTO FIVE DIMENSIONS IS ALMOST
UPON THEM - Cooper BRACES HIMSELF -
COOPER
What happens now -?
BAM - he is swept up in the expansion like a tiny leaf on a
CHURNING WAVE -
Cooper FLIES through the EXPANDING COSMOS, past PLANETS
ORBITING STARS, WHICH BECOME ATOMIC PARTICLES, WHICH BECOME
MATTER, BECOMING STARS ...
Cooper APPROACHES A GLASSY TUBE. Inside is the OLD,
UNDAMAGED ENDURANCE. As Cooper looks in from the bulk he
sees: Brand, strapped in, Doyle opposite, traversing the
wormhole for the first time ...
Cooper REACHES for Brand ... She sees something, reaches up
- their hands would touch if they weren’t in different
dimensions, her fingers distorting the space of his fingers
-
WHAM! She, and the Endurance, are SWEPT PAST - Cooper is
SMASHED into the spacetime of the wormhole - he SCREAMS AND
WE -
149.
INT. OUTER SPACE - LATER
Cooper FLOATS, dead or unconscious, near Saturn. In the
distance we see two Rangers approaching ...
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Cooper’s eyes flicker open. A bright room with an open
window, net curtains obscuring the view. We hear the CRACK
of a baseball off a bat. Children LAUGHING.
VOICE
(O.S.)
Mr Cooper? Mr Cooper?
Cooper looks over to see a Nurse and a Doctor watching him.
He tries to sit up.
DOCTOR
Take it slow, sir. Remember you’re
no spring chicken any more.
(Amused.)
I gather you’re one hundred and
twenty-four years old.
(Checks Cooper’s chart.)
You were extremely lucky. The
Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply -
COOPER
Where am I?
The Doctor, almost surprised, TURNS, moves to the window,
opens the curtains. Where Cooper should see sky, he sees a
CURVING UPSIDE-DOWN TOWN ...
DOCTOR
Cooper Station. Currently orbiting
Saturn.
The Nurse helps Cooper to the window. He looks out at the
VAST CYLINDRICAL STATION - cornfields and buildings. Outside
his window, kids are playing baseball. The batter hits a POP
FLY ... the kids watch it up and up, until it carries on,
falling up towards the buildings above. The kids SHOUT a
warning - the ball smashes a skylight. Cooper watches the
kids laugh.
COOPER
Nice of you to name the place after
me.
The Nurse giggles. The Doctor shoots her a look -
150.
What?
DOCTOR
The station wasn’t named after you,
sir ... It was named after your
daughter.
Cooper smiles at this ...
DOCTOR
Although, she’s always maintained
just how important you were -
COOPER
Is she ...
(Braces.)
still alive?
DOCTOR
She’ll be here in a couple weeks.
She’s really far too old for a
transfer from another station, but
when she heard you’d been found ...
well, this is Murphy Cooper we’re
talking about.
COOPER
(marveling)
Yes, it is ...
The Doctor is wrapping up -
DOCTOR
We’ll have you checked out in a
couple days.
Cooper turns back to the window, thinking ...
ADMINISTRATOR
(V.O.)
I’m sure you’ll be excited to see
what’s in store ...
INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - DAY
The ADMINISTRATOR, thirties, leads Cooper along a walkway -
ADMINISTRATOR
We’ve got a nice situation for you
...
151.
Cooper looks down at a line of SLEEK NEXT-GENERATION
RANGERS. Sees a PILOT climb into one. Mechanics work another
...
ADMINISTRATOR
I actually did a paper on you in
high school, sir. I know all about
your life on Earth ...
EXT. TOWN SQUARE, COOPER STATION - CONTINUOUS
Cooper looks at the strangely ordinary town the
Administrator is walking him through ...
ADMINISTRATOR
So when I made my suggestion to Ms
Cooper, I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect ...
EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The Adminstrator leads Cooper through a cornfield ... The
old farmhouse is there, preserved. As Cooper approaches, a
small monitor starts playing the footage of OLD-TIMERS from
the start of the movie.
ADMINISTRATOR
Of course, I didn’t speak to her
personally ...
As Cooper passes the monitor it changes to a FAMILIAR OLD
LADY, but Cooper misses it ...
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
OLD-TIMERS play on video screens: a museum exhibit. The
Administrator holds the door open for Cooper.
ADMINISTRATOR
But she confirmed just how much you
loved farming.
COOPER
She did, huh?
Cooper looks over the kitchen. Cooper sees a
familiar-looking articulated machine -
152.
COOPER
Is that ...?
ADMINISTRATOR
The machine we found out near
Saturn when we found you, yes. Its
power source was shot, but we could
get you another if you want to try
and get it up and running again.
Cooper turns to the Administrator.
COOPER
Please.
INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - EVENING
Cooper, from the catwalk, watches the last of the Rangers
come back from patrol. The PILOT jumps down as the ground
crew wheels it into its place in the line of sleek ships.
INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Cooper has Tars’ head laid out on the kitchen table.
TARS
Settings: general settings,
security setting -
COOPER
Honesty. New level setting.
Ninety-five percent.
TARS
Confirmed. Additional
customization?
COOPER
Yes. Humor, seventy-five percent.
Wait.
(Thinks.)
Sixty percent.
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters, nervous. A nurse is there.
COOPER
Is she -?
153.
NURSE
The family’s all in there.
COOPER
The family?
NURSE
They all came along to see her -
she’s been in cryo-sleep for almost
two years.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Cooper cautiously pushes open the door. The bed is
surrounded by people, grown-up children, grandchildren,
babies ... They turn to look at him: some SMILES, some
CURIOUS looks, a small child HIDES behind a parent’s leg ...
Cooper approaches, and the family parts to let him see an
ELDERLY WOMAN, lying in the bed, FRAIL.
She looks up at Cooper. Delighted. Tears of joy. She reaches
up to him ... he takes her hands.
COOPER
Murph.
MURPH
Dad.
(To the others.)
Please.
Her voice is a frail whisper. With authority. The family
shuffles out. Cooper watches them go, turns back to Murph.
COOPER
You told them I like farming.
Murph smiles, still mischievous. Cooper marvels at her.
COOPER
Murph, it was me. I was your ghost.
MURPH
I know ...
She lifts her wrist - the WATCH is there ...
MURPH
People didn’t believe me, they
thought I’d done it all myself ...
(Taps watch.)
(MORE)
154.
MURPH (cont’d)
But I knew who it was ...
COOPER
A father looks in his child’s eyes
and thinks - maybe it’s them -
maybe my child will save the world.
MURPH
And everyone, once a child, wants
to looks into their own dad’s eyes
and know he saw. But, usually, by
then, the father is gone. Nobody
believed me, but I knew you’d come
back.
COOPER
How?
MURPH
Because my dad promised me.
Cooper is crying now.
COOPER
I’m here now. I’m here for you,
Murph.
Murph is shaking her head.
MURPH
No parent should have to watch
their child die. My kids are here
for me now. Go.
COOPER
Where?
MURPH
(it’s so obvious)
Brand.
And the family comes back in as Cooper releases Murph’s
hand, stepping back to let Murph’s kids and grandkids swarm
over her ... He watches them, their love, as if from another
dimension. A man out of time. A ghost.
MURPH
(V.O.)
She’s out there ...
155.
EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand, in suit and helmet, stands watching Case excavate a
pod, buried under a massive rock fall. She is crying.
MURPH
(V.O.)
Setting up camp ...
EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
MECHANIC finishes looking over one of the sleek new Rangers.
He packs his tools and heads out.
A figure unfolds itself in the shadows - Tars. He picks his
way through the shadows, unlocks the door. Cooper DARTS in
...
EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand kneels in front of a small CROSS. Edmunds’ nameplate
hangs from it.
MURPH
... Alone in a strange galaxy ...
She unseals her helmet - PULLS IT OFF ...
INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
Cooper and Tars scurry down the line of sleek ships. Cooper
points - Tars starts working the hatch mechanism, while
Cooper KEEPS WATCH ...
EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY
Brand, helmet off, BREATHES. And breathes again.
MURPH
(V.O.)
Maybe, right now, she’s settling in
for the long nap ...
156.
INT. RANGER IN HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT
Cooper STRAPS into the pilot’s chair, Tars beside him. The
outer doors slide open. They look out at the inky blackness
of space ...
EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK
Brand looks at the setting sun ...
MURPH
(V.O.)
By the light of our new sun ...
INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - MORNING
The Mechanic opening up, walks along the row of ships until
-
One is MISSING.
EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK
Brand turns from the dwindling light ...
MURPH
(V.O.)
In our new home.
She heads down through the twilight towards camp. And we -
Fade out.

BRUCE: I'm asking for your help.

I believe there is a stranger

He comes in the winter

Brings fish.

He comes on the king tide.

That was last night.

(SPEAKING ICELANDIC)

Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

Well, this stranger doesn't come
by ship.

There are enemies coming from far away.

I need warriors.

I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

Look, I'll give you 25,000

(BRUCE GRUNTS)

Arthur Curry.

Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

The Aquaman.

I hear you can talk to fish.

(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

ARTHUR: So let me get this straight.

You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

Oh, that shithole.

When the fight comes, we'll need you.

- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

'Cause I don't like you coming here,

digging into my business
and getting into my life.

People from Atlantis tell me, "Do this."
Now you say, "Do that."

I wanna be left alone.

Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

'Cause you can just leave?

I help them 'cause no one else does.

If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

"Strong man is strongest alone."
You ever heard that?

BRUCE: That's not a saying.

That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

Yeah...

Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

You ever hear of Superman?

He died fighting next to me.

My point exactly.

What's in the three boxes?

It's ancient history.

What is it?

Mankind's melting the polar ice caps,
destroying the ecosystem.

They got it coming?

Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise.

How about if they boil?

Dressed like a bat.

You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this Aquaman?

BRUCE: Oh, I put a tracking device
in his coat,

but he left without it.

May, in fact, not have been his coat.

Those squares from Luthor's notes.

I think they must be containers
of some kind.

Of What?

I don't know. Money. Power.

- Something worth starting a war over.
- Hmm.

Well, we've had luck with one person
on the team list.

Barry Allen of Central City.

He's completely off the grid.

Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

Disappearing act.

But he does visit his father.

In prison for murdering his mother.

Jesus.

Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence.

But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.

We have somebody at the prison?

Oh, yeah. We'll find the address.

What about, uh, Diana?

Well, you have her number.

What, you could've called her.

Oh. Perhaps I should fly to Paris
with a handwritten note.

"Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no."

I'm only interested in her skillset.

(SCOFFING) I'm sure you are.

Can we?

Uh, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

But they've got a partial match.

A Victor Stone.

Genius IQ,

football scholarship to GCU
and deceased.

Figures. Fairy tales and ghost stories.

One misses the days

when one's biggest concerns
were exploding wind-up penguins.

The simple life.

I don't recognize this world.

I don't have to recognize it.

I just have to save it.

No, there's no problem.

- (SCOFFS) Better not be.
- (GATE BUZZES)

You know where to go.

(GATE BUZZES)

Are those prescription?

Or are you just trying to look brainy?

HENRY: Because you're
holding yourself back.

You're going in circles.

You're working three dead-end jobs,
going on four.

Where do you even have the time?

I make the time.

And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

The investigation was botched.

Give me your hand, man.

(HENRY SIGHS)

I want you to listen to me, Barry,
because I mean this.

I want you to give all that up.

And I want you to stop coming to see me.

I am a drag on your life.

(SIGHS)

Please don't ever say that to me again.

Please?

You can be whatever you want to be.
You're brilliant, man.

Absolute best of the best.

I can't sit here

and watch you run in place
in Central City

for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

- Dad, that's not true. That's not true.
- GUARD: It's time.

Let's go, Allen. Allen!

I want you to make your own future.

You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

- GUARD: Open gate.

(SIRENS BLARING)

Lab's all yours, Howard.

11:30. Early night for you, Silas.

Yes. Early.

I never got to say...

I'm very sorry about what happened.

Victor was a wonderful kid.

Thank you.

SILAS: Victor.

Victor, you're not stuck up here.

You can have a life.
You can have more than...

(SIGHS)

If you stay up here brooding--

VICTOR: I'm processing.

I can access everything.

But I can't put it all together.

Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

VICTOR: So you'd do to someone else
what you did to me.

No.

The box stays hidden.

If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

get it powered up and--

Does anybody know?

What?

VICTOR; At the lab.

Does anybody know I'm alive?

Uh... (STAMMERS)

- I didn't think you were ready for--
- To what?

For them to see the monster?

You are not a monster.

It's weird that you thought I meant me.

What I did...

I lost your mother in that accident.

I wasn't about to...

I couldn't bear to lose my son.

But you did.

I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

It's not just digital. It's alien.

(SCRAPING)

Every day, I wake up different.

Modified.

How do you...

(THUDS)

Couldn't do that last night.

Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton

people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

GARRET: Hey, Lane.

Who was your source, um,

Well, it's my source.

I got tapped for the kidnapping story.

There were all those student protests.
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political.

So, who's your guy?

Well, I'll see if she'll take your call.

(CHUCKLES) So it's a she. Hmm.

It's not a she.

- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

He said you could smell a story

Well, stories just made sense.

It was about the truth.

ALFRED: Victor Stone. Deceased.

(PLAYING DIFFERENT ALARM TONES)

Yeah, it looked expensive.

I once knew a man

Yeah.

We're gonna need more than a pilot.

I think there's an attack coming.

Not coming, Bruce.

It's already here.

They called him Steppenwolf,
the end of worlds.

He lived only to conquer.

Millions fell before his blade,

- or rose again as his Parademons.

(SCREECHING)

Yeah, I think I met one.

We didn't hit it Off.

Here in Gotham?

BRUCE: They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

DIANA: The Mother Boxes.

Mother Boxes.

I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

That leaves two more.

I'm impressed.

Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

A weapon? Some kind of power?

They don't contain power.

They are power.

Carried from planet to planet,

the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.

An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,

but transforms them
into the primordial hellscape

of Steppenwolf's birth world.

We should have died.

But we formed our own unity.

Amazons, Atlanteans,

all the tribes of men
fought side by side.

(ALL YELLING)

Warriors of legend,

(YELLING)

allies from other worlds,

even the gods themselves
all acted as one.

Laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.

Some say it drove him mad.

The disgrace of his first retreat.

He swore our alliance would crumble.

That darkness would cover the Earth.

(ALL CHEERING)

And that he would return when it did.

Left behind,

the Mother Boxes were too dangerous
to be kept together.

One was entrusted to the Amazons.

One to the Atlanteans.

Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.

The Box of Men was buried in secret

so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.

Such harmony out of such horror.

It was truly an Age of Heroes.

Something tells me we're not getting
the band back together.

The Atlanteans were forced undersea,

and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

Well, I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

We tend to act like the Doomsday Clock
has a snooze button.

- How long until--
- Days.

At most.

Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

He wanted to make the Earth kneel
before he destroyed us.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

This time he'll just go after the boxes.

BRUCE: I got a location for
one of our recruits. Barry Allen.

What about the other one?
Victor Stone?

I was hoping you would dig him up.

(SIGHS)

We're asking people we don't know
to risk their lives.

I know.

That's how this works.

(TRAIN HORN HOOTING)

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

You said that like it explains

why there's a total stranger
in my place

sitting in the dark
in my second favorite chair.

Tell me about this.

This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

Very attractive Jewish boy.

Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?

Or railroads?

I know you have abilities.

I just don't know what they are.

My special skills include viola,

web design, fluent in sign language...

Gorilla sign language.

Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

It's what they use on the space shuttle

to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

I do very competitive ice dancing.

Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

(EXHALES)

You're the Batman?

So, you're fast.

That feels like an oversimplification.

I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

You see, I believe enemies are coming.

Stop right there. I'm in.

- You are?
- Yeah, uh...

I need friends.

People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus. They, uh...

They have, like, a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

Like brunch!

Like, what is brunch?

You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

I mean...

I don't know.

People are a little slow. (SIGHS)

I'll try to keep up.

Can I keep this?

It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

and it seems to manipulate space-time.

I call it the Speed Force.

Causes me to burn
a tremendous amount of calories.

So I'm just a black hole of snacks.

I am a "snack" hole.

How many people
are on this special fight team?

Three, including you.

Three? Against what?

I'll tell you on the plane.

The plane?

What are your superpowers again?

I'm rich.

(ENGINE STARTS)

(TYPING)

ALFRED: The program always gets twitchy
with this footage.

You know who we are.

Are you Victor Stone?

I need to speak to you.

No. Face-to-face.

I'm old-fashioned that way.

If I was going to attack you,
I would have done it by the lake.

Looks like you have a date, Ms. Prince.

About time somebody here did.

VICTOR: Face-to-face.

I've been doing some tracking.

What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge...

I'll let you know.

DIANA: That's not good enough.

Not good enough?

For you.

Look, I don't know you, and I don't know
how you got these gifts.

Gifts?

No one else can do what you do.

If these are gifts,

then why am I the one paying for them?

We need you, Victor.

And maybe you need us.

I do fine alone.

I told myself the same for a long time.

I lost someone I loved once.

I shut myself off...

From everyone.

But I had to learn
to open back up again.

The truth is I'm still working on it.

And if you agreed to meet me,

you're working on it, too.

Trust me, Victor.

FISHERMAN: Mayday! Mayday!

Something came down from the sky!

To ocean's rage.

It's on him.

You took a hell of a hit.

You all right?

(SCOFFS) At last.

The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

Wait.

Please.

I knew her.

Well, that makes one of us.

When my parents fought in the wars

she took me in.

What a saint.

You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

and never gave me another thought.

Your mother left you to save your life.

Cannot imagine how it hurt her.

What it cost her.

But you're not a defenseless child now.

It would have been her responsibility

to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

Now,

it's yours.

Then I'm gonna need something from you.

STEPPENWOLF: I see, Mother.

I see why you waited to summon me.

The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.

Amazons, Atlanteans,

each stands and falls alone.

I know, Mother,
you've waited too long for the unity.

I know. But you will feed.

And my exile will come to an end.

I will take my place among the New Gods.

Find the last one!

Its power will cleanse this world.

For the unity!

For Darkseid.

Oh, Victor.

(SNARLING)

OFFICER: Asshole!

CRISPUS: Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

All the vics work for S.T.A.R. Labs.

"Attacked by a flying vampire."

"Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs."

One of them was a little kid.

Scared.
Won't say a word but drew this.

- Looks like--
- GORDON: I know what it looks like.

Come on, you think he fights criminals
for 20 years here

and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

I'll talk to him tonight.

CRISPUS: World's gone crazy, Jim.

Maybe he did, too.

BRUCE: Did you find the cyborg?

DIANA: We spoke.

Give him time.

You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

That's not right. Great.

- (SIGHS) So this is us?
- BRUCE: Yeah, this is us.

Oh!

Awesome!

That's the Bat-Signal! That's your...
Oh. Shh.

(SOFTLY) Sorry. That's your signal.

That means we have to go now.

Yeah, that's... That's what that means.

BARRY: It's so cool. (CHUCKLING)

(THUNDER CRASHING)

How many of you are there?

Not enough.

GORDON: Eight people abducted from
or near S.T.A.R. Labs.

Here's the potential perp.

Parademons.

Okay.

The demons must have
caught the scent of the Mother Box.

They carried people away to find out
what they know.

- So the eight may still be alive.
- CYBORG: Nine.

(FLASH GASPS)

The head of S.T.A.R. Labs
was taken as well.

WONDER WOMAN: You made it.

So then, there must be a nest nearby.

I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

No pattern I can see.

The lines on the map don't converge.

On land.

These lead back to Braxton Island
between the two cities.

BATMAN: Gotham Harbor.

These are air vents.

They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project

that was abandoned in '29.

Do you really think that...

Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

Huh? Oh.

That's rude.

(RATS SQUEAKING)

- Where are we, Alfred?
- ALFRED: Braxton Island.

You should be directly under
the venting tower for the tunnel.

Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.

It'll give you access
to the machine room.

CYBORG: Define "access."

BATMAN: One at a time.
The bridge may not...

Hold.

STEPPENWOLF: Just tell me the truth.

I have a family.

STEPPENWOLF: Wrong answer.

The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.

Shall I feed them?

You've been near the Mother Box.
Her scent is on you.

Please. We have families.

Why does everyone keep telling me that?

HOWARD: Please, please.

STEPPENWOLF: I don't need to hurt you...

Right. Okay, yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

See, I'm afraid of bugs and, uh,
guns and obnoxiously tall people.

- And murder. And I can't be here.
- (PARADEMON SCREECHING)

It's really cool you guys seem ready
to do battle and stuff,

but full transparency,
I've never done battle.

I've just pushed some people
and run away.

Save one.

What?

Save one person.

Uh... Which one?

Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

And then?

You'll know.

Okay.

- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)

STEPPENWOLF: Useless.

You then.

Where is my Mother Box?

I'll die before I tell you.

At last, one that doesn't whine.

But you will scream.

Dad.

SILAS: Victor.

Ah. You were born of her.

A creature of chaos.

Not how I see it.

Ahh!

(BATMAN GRUNTING)

At the end of the hall,

His Mother Box.

You have to keep him from it.

You haven't lost your touch.

But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

(LAUGHS)

Dressed like a bat.

I dig it.

May be temporary.

So, what made you change your mind?

AQUAMAN: Steppenwolf.

He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

If he doesn't already have it.

He doesn't have it.

(PARADEMONS SCREECHING)

(PARENTS SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

(PARADEMONS SCREECHING)

Wow! It's like a cave.

Like a Batcave.

BRUCE: Barry.

VICTOR: My father called it
a change engine.

It was found by the British
during World War I.

They studied it, but they
couldn't even date it, it's so old.

It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

Then she lit up like Christmas.

They brought it to S.T.A.R. Labs

where my father recognized it
as a perpetual energy matrix.

Oh, that sounds cool.
I thought it was like a nuclear bomb.

A Mother Box destroys as it creates.

It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

My father thought it was
the key to unlimited energy.

New formulas.

Cellular regeneration.

But it's too volatile to control.

He used it on you.

I was in an accident.

Should've died.

My father thought
that he could use the Mother Box

to rebuild the broken parts of me
with a few cybernetic enhancements.

Instead, he built a living machine

that may be stronger than its host.

BRUCE: Too much.

Too much life.

What's on your weird mind?

BRUCE: Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

A human being can only absorb so much.

The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

So?

So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

If you were in a conductive field,

a boost from the Mother Box--

Could bring him back to life.

The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic
chamber, which would be a perfect--

No.

- BRUCE: Diana.
- Bruce, no.

You have no idea what kind of power
you are dealing with.

Even if there's a fraction of a chance?

That what? That we could raise a monster
like Luthor did?

We have tech Luthor's never even seen.

Superman is dead.

We all wish he weren't.

We don't know what state he's in.

We know we can't bring him back.

But this is science beyond our limits.

And that's what science is for.
To do what's never been done.

To make life better.

Or to end it.

Technology is like any other power.

Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

You're risking lives.

Theirs and maybe countless more.

We don't have time for a control group.

Is it a risk? Yes. But it's necessary.

Why, because of your guilt?

(SIGHS)

Bruce, I was there.

You didn't kill Superman.

At some point, even you have to learn
to move on.

Steve Trevor tell you that?

(GROANS)

(BRUCE CLEARS THROAT)

Superman was a beacon to the world.

Why aren't you?

You're an inspiration, Diana.

You don't just save people,

you make them see their better selves.

And yet, I'd never heard of you

until Luthor lured you out by stealing
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

You shut yourself down for a century,
so let's not talk about me moving on.

You know that if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

We are not enough!

Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

And I promise you, Steppenwolf is not
out there talking about ethics.

He's trying to burn down the world!

The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power,

this power, against him.

I agree.

I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the Mother Box,

but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole

and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.

Right, right. But we mean bring him back
in like a "Yay, he's back!" way,

not in like a Pet Sematary scenario.

You lose something when you die.

Even Superman.

Maybe not his mind.

Maybe his soul.

I'll have a contingency plan for that.

If he wakes up
and you're the first thing he sees,

you'll need one.

(ALARM TONE BLARING ON RECORDING)

Well, that was fun while it didn't last.

BRUCE: She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

I don't see why you're pushing her.

We have to boost the signal.

Put it through the Batmobile speakers.

Yeah, now you're changing the subject.

I have a contingency.

Diana was right about the risk.

If the plan goes south,
we're gonna bring in the big guns.

But that's not...

Those are very big guns.

You've got a team here.

Superman would bring this team together
better than I ever could.

- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

Or what abilities you might have--

He was more human than I am.

He lived in this world.

Fell in love. Had a job.

Despite all that power.

The world needs Superman.

And the team needs Clark.

And what does Clark need?

Maybe he's at peace.

He'll get over it.

(DIGGING)

BARRY: You know, I could do this
a lot faster. I just...

Is it weird that it feels disrespectful?

Yep.

Do... Do you feel a sense of confidence

that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

Not really.

- Okay, then why--
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

The stories Diana told us.
I believe them.

But we gotta stop him.

That's the plan.

That's the plan.

Okay. We're not ready for...

...racially charged...

You got struck by lightning, huh?

Uh, yeah, that's the abridged version.

- And you...
- Explosion.

Woke up in a lab.

So we're the accidents.

Yeah, that's us. (SCOFFS)

Hey. No, no.

(CLANGS)

CYBORG: We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.

ETA 30 seconds.

I'm here for him.

- I swear I would never--
- Save it.

- Okay.
- Okay.

Okay.

This is amazing.

This is crazy.

Oh, what, now it's crazy?

You lunatics better know
what you're doing.

AI: Welcome.

CYBORG: Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

I might be able to do it.

I might be able to jump-start it.

If I can get enough distance,

I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

I might be able to wake the box.

- If that's still what we want.
- We have to try.

This must be the end of the line.

So, I'm in position.

CYBORG: The Mother Box is ready.

You have to charge it
the moment it touches the fluid.

- Five.
- Five.

Diana's right. This is a bad idea.

- Four.
- Four.

- CYBORG: Three.

Do you bleed?

Please.

Yeah, something is definitely bleeding.

He has the last one.

You brought us here.

You remembered.

This is home.

You smell good.

Did I not before?

(GRUNTS)

Don't do that.

ARTHUR: We just got our asses
handed to us.

And Steppenwolf has got the third box.

DIANA: So we find them.

If the boxes are even close
to each other,

there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

VICTOR: Steppenwolf's gonna
be keeping them

somewhere where they don't read.

No Internet, no satellite coverage.

- Well, that narrows it down.
- VICTOR: Not enough.

So, you can't find them.

Or maybe you don't want to.

Arthur.

Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

Right. 'Cause you can't control
the machine.

Uh, so, is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

Very hungry.

Victor.

You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

I promise, we will pull you back out.

Just keep the little merman away from me
while I work.

Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry.

When you come back, get online.
Everybody checks everybody else's work.

Listen. (CLEARS THROAT)

I was wondering if you could
put out a, you know, a feeler.

Like, aquatic. You know.

I don't know... Do you talk to fish?

The water does the talking.

Of course.

If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

Okay.

(BRUCE GROANING)

DIANA: Wait.

Let me.

It's just a little out of place.

(SIGHS) So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

He could've killed you.

I was willing to make the trade.

And bringing in Lois Lane?

Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

- I bet you...
- (CRACKING)

(STRAINED)
...thought I wasn't listening.

Thank you.

(BRUCE SIGHS)

You know you can't do this forever.

I can barely do it now.

Steppenwolf.

This is the job.

It's my job.

And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

Not leading.

You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor--

It wasn't my business. I'm sorry.

You were pushing me to lead the team,

but leaders get people killed.

I fought always

when I was needed.

But to lead, to step into the light
and to say to people,

"This is worth your life."

When it's your fault...

They're all Steve Trevor.

We make it through tonight,
you can stay in the shadows forever.

Dress up like a bat.

I won't even sue.

If we get through the night.

(GLASSES CLINK)

Are you okay?

You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

CLARK: I know. It's...

I just got out of a wooden box.

What was it like?

Coming back?

Itchy.

I mean, honestly,

weird in so many ways.

But mostly just--

I wasn't strong.

I didn't, um...

You would've been
very disappointed in me.

I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter. I just...

It's okay.

I'm the idiot who left.

But I'm back now.

And I'm gonna make things right.

Ah.

You called Mom.

Of course.

Thank you.

I was hoping it was gonna take you
longer to recover.

Why?

Because now I have to send you away.

Bruce.

He needs you.

Fate of the world, I think that's
the deal. He was pretty tense.

- Well, I guess I do owe him one.
- (CHUCKLES)

Right.

But no dying.

And I get the exclusive.

Yes, ma'am.

(TRUCK APPROACHING)

(MARTHA WHIMPERING)

Are you really you?

I'm really me, Ma.

MARTHA: Oh!

At last.

Praise to the unity!

The three as one!

Praise to the mother of horrors.

DIANA: Is Steppenwolf there?

(DISTORTED) Just a minute.

Sorry.

It's Pozharnov in northern Russia.

The nuclear plant.

Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

Uh-huh. There have been some attempts
to resettle nearby.

But it looks like really rough sledding.

Who picks this place to put down roots?

People that have been kicked out
of everywhere else.

VICTOR: The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.

- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

Transport won't fly that fast.

It will for me.

VICTOR: The unity brings all three boxes
together in perfect sync.

Its power builds
until it can't be contained.

But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

its energy will cascade, form a loop.

They'll feed on each other.

BARRY: And that's it?
We just pull them apart?

No fuss, no muss.

Separating the boxes
is still gonna cause a massive surge.

I'll have to be there.

But you guys should think about
getting clear.

We're with you till it's done.

Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

And you know what?

I don't mind. It's an honorable end.

But we gotta shut Steppenwolf down.

Superman's a no-show.

You got no powers. No offense.

This guy might be working for the enemy,
we don't know.

You're tripping over your feet and mine.

Oof...

You're gorgeous.

And fierce, and strong, and... Mmm.

I know we went to war with the Amazons,
but that was before my time.

And you know what? I don't wanna die.

I'm young.
There's shit that I want to do.

I just feel like I didn't really
embrace the sea or the land.

I've been a loner my whole life.

But being part of something
bigger like this...

Maybe I'm scared because I'm meant to--

(SIGHS)

I think that was beautiful.

You say a word about this

and you'll meet every piranha I know.

I honestly didn't hear anything after,
"We're all gonna die."

(RUMBLING)

(JET APPROACHING)

Ah. Let them come.

I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

You get to Steppenwolf.

Don't wait for me, just do the job.

(LOIS AND MARTHA CHUCKLING)

How did you get the house back
from the bank?

I bought the bank.

CLARK: The whole bank?

BRUCE: It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

What?

It's actually the worst job you can get
in a crime lab.

But, uh, my foot's in the door.

Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

This is like a "job" job?

"Job" job.

Look at you go.

LOIS: Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.

It is the conviction
that the light will never return.

BRUCE: Must be 100, 150 feet.

Must be.

Big round table.

Six chairs, right there.

But room for more.

But room for more.

LOIS: But the light always returns

to show us things familiar.

Home, family,

and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.

It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.

THIEF: Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

LOIS: This time,
the light shone on the heroes

coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.

Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.

But these heroes
were here the whole time

to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.

All you have to do is look,

up in the sky.

(SONIC BOOM)

I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

Not at all, Barry.

Curious myself.

Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

Well, it is a competition.

But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

But if I win, you're off the team.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

- No...
- Oof.

If I Win...

Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

I feel stung by that.

Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

Deal.

Which coast?

Uh, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

Which is that way.

No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.

To put it plainly,

shouldn't we have a league of our own?

After the opening logos, leaves start falling and we hear a voice-over.

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): There was a time above... A time before...

The camera pans up, two coffins are being carried to a crypt.

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): There were perfect things. Diamond absolutes. But things fall... Things on Earth...

Cut to another angle, a mansion is seen in the distance, and three people are ahead of the coffins: an elderly man, a British guy with a hat (ALFRED PENNYWORTH) and a boy....

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): And what falls is fallen.

...who just before entering the crypt starts running.

ALFRED: Master Wayne. Bruce! Bruce, it's alright. Bruce, please.

As young Bruce Wayne passes by tombstones, he enters a nearby forest. Cut to black.

OPENING CREDITS

Scenes of Bruce Wayne running through the woods and eventually falling down an open trapdoor are intercut with the events that lead to the funeral, where outside a screening of Zorro, Bruce's parents THOMAS and MARTHA WAYNE are shot by a mugger.

THOMAS: Martha...

In the underground cave, Bruce sees an enormous group of bats hanging from a nearby ceiling. They wake up and fly in his direction. Eventually Bruce calms down, is surrounded, and starts floating towards the open trapdoor as the circle of bats fly towards there. As the screen turns to white, the voiceover returns. 

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): In the dream they took me to the light. A beautiful lie.

Letters in the white screen…

METROPOLIS - MANKIND IS INTRODUCED TO SUPERMAN

Cross-fade to: METROPOLIS HARBOR A helicopter is landing as above it, fighter jets shoot missiles. Out of the helicopter comes adult BRUCE WAYNE, who runs as soon as he hits the ground. We see what Bruce is looking at and where the jets intend to shoot – the Kryptonian ship floating above the center of Metropolis, firing a beam to destroy the area below it. A falling jet crashes on an overpass just as Bruce starts an car, driving towards the carnage.

Bruce drives in the mostly empty streets as fire, debris and dust clouds occasionally force him to turn corners. He then grabs his cell phone and makes a call.

Cut to: OFFICE In the Wayne Financial office room, an elderly executive answers the phone.

BRUCE WAYNE (O.S.): Jack.

JACK: Bruce.

Bruce in the car.

BRUCE WAYNE: Jack, listen to me. I want you to get everyone out of the building. Right now.

Jack staring at the Kryptonian ship from his window.

BRUCE WAYNE (O.S.): You understand?

Once the gravity beam hits the ground, destroying nearby skyscrapers, the Wayne Financial employees scream. Two women even say "Oh my God" and "Away from the windows!" Jack downs the phone and starts screaming at the employees.

JACK: Let's go. Come on, start moving now, people. Let's go. The boss wants us out of the building. So, let's make it happen.

People are leaving as we cut to Bruce driving again.

BRUCE WAYNE: Jack. Jack!

Letting off the phone, Bruce continues taking turns as he faces cars crashing, planes falling, and firemen barricades. At a certain point, we see above the car the falling Fortress of Solitude, which is crashing into the city, bringing down several skyscrapers in the process.

Once Bruce sees a crowd standing in the middle of the street and the Kryptonian ship not firing beams anymore, he stops. Bruce steps out of the vehicle, seeing a plane - with lightning coming out of it - crash into the spacecraft, before igniting something that sends in a loud blast at the crowd around Bruce. As the ship is sucked in by some sort of singularity, Bruce runs down the chaotic streets. Back at Wayne Financial, Jack stands at the empty office, staring at the destroyed downtown from the window. A building is blasted and the projectile is flying towards the Wayne building - Superman. He hits the floors below Jack's offices; the building shakes and lights flicker. At that time, Bruce is on a street where he can see his building, and tries calling Jack again. Just as the automated error message (“We're sorry. All services are busy now. Will you please try your call again later?“) plays, Wayne sees a heat vision beam shredding through the Wayne Financial Building.

Back in the office, whose floor is being ripped apart by beams, Jack, still by the window, says a prayer.

JACK: Heaven god. Creator of heaven and earth. Have mercy on my soul.

Bruce watches in horror as the building collapses.

BRUCE WAYNE: JACK!!!

Bruce fearlessly runs right into the falling debris, desperate to try and save someone - in contrast to all the others are running away. The dust engulfs him.

At the dusty yet silent ruins, Bruce passes by a police horse and some people before hearing someone call his name.

WALLACE: Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

Wallace Keefe is on the ground, his legs trapped underneath rubble. Bruce approaches him.

WALLACE: I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs.

BRUCE WAYNE: We need help over here!

WALLACE: Help me. [grabs Bruce's arm] I can't feel my legs.

BRUCE WAYNE: You're going to be okay, you hear me? [sees the name tag] Wallace. What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

WALLACE: You're the boss, Boss.

Bruce gives an asserting smile before taking Wallace's hand off him as some people have arrived to help. Two grab Wallace by his arms and lift him...

BYSTANDERS: Alright. You're going to be okay. Easy, easy. Come on. ...and then Bruce lifts the debris. Wallace is pulled back, his lower legs visibly damaged.

WALLACE: Oh my god. I can't feel my leg. I can't... I can't feel my legs.

Bruce sees a girl about to be crushed by falling debris, and saves her.

BRUCE WAYNE: It's okay. You're going to be okay. You're okay, alright? Huh? Okay, you know what? We're going to find your mom. Where is she?

The crying girl points at a destroyed skyscraper. Bruce gives her a hug to comfort her as he looks up to the sky and witness as meteorites fall on another building - along with the battling Superman and General Zod out of the sky. Eventually another skyscraper prevents Bruce from seeing the rest of the battle, but he still angrily stares at what the Kryptonians have done.

Cut to black, then text reading 18 MONTHS LATER.

SOMEWHERE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN In front of a destroyed Kryptonian artifact, a team of Indian divers explore an underwater area and take a strange rock from the seafloor. They bring it back to land, showing the rock to an elderly white man. Breaking it with an axe, he finds inside a large nugget of a green mineral – Kryptonite.

NAIROMI, AFRICA

A Land Rover drives through a desert village amidst a sandstorm, parking near a stone fortress. Two people are brought out of the car with bags in their heads by the African militia, and then let through the gates. The first revealed is LOIS LANE, who sees a Slavic man wearing sunglasses – ANATOLI - before from his back comes the militia’s leader, GENERAL AMAJAGH. Lois walks towards him as Amajagh slouches in a chair, and takes out a small notepad.

LOIS LANE: Are you a terrorist, general?

GENERAL AMAJAGH: They did not tell me the interview was with a lady.

LOIS LANE: I'm not a lady, I'm a journalist.

As we hear Amajagh’s response, the other man who left with Lois from the car, Jimmy, is taking photographs when the Slav puts his hand in front of the lens, and grabs the camera. Jimmy gives in, and lets him take the camera.

GENERAL AMAJAGH (OS): What I am, is a man with nothing, except a love of my people.

The Russian rewinds the camera, opens it…

JIMMY: Uh, don't open... You just exposed...

…and takes out the film while dropping the camera, complete with pulling the reel out of the cartridge.

LOIS LANE: Who's paying for these security contractors, general?

GENERAL AMAJAGH: Who pays for the drones that pass over our heads at night? One question begs another. Yes?

The Slav tosses the cartridge on the ground, and steps on it, discovering inside a tracking device glowing a light. He then shows it to the militia that drove Lois there.

ANATOLI: CIA.

MILITIA: They're tracking us!

The Russian breaks the tracker while the militia surround Jimmy, brings him to his knees, and an angry Amajagh gets up and grabs a gun from a lackey to walk towards the photographer.

AMAJAGH: You!

Lois starts walking towards Jimmy…

LOIS LANE: No!

…and two henchmen next to her grab her arms to stop her. Jimmy starts talking in subtitled foreign language.

JIMMY: Not her. We just used her credentials as cover. She doesn't know anything. [in English] It's okay, Lois.

Jimmy is then executed with a shot to the head.

Cut to black… …and then inside a building, Amajagh closes a metal door before approaching Lois.

LOIS LANE: I... I didn't know.

GENERAL AMAJAGH: Ignorance is not the same... as innocence. Miss Lane.

Outside, the Slav looks around in the sky, until some of the mercenaires, wearing black fatigues, nod positively to him. The Russian shoots the militia, even the driver as he surrenders. As Amajagh turns his head to listen closely, the mercenaries are shooting the militia. Then the General gets behind Lois…

GENERAL AMAJAGH: Get up! Stand up!

…and holds a gun to her head. Outside, one of the bullets hits Lois’s notebook.

One of the mercenaries open the fortress gates, showing the Slav and his companions in motorcycles.

ANATOLI: Move out!

They start the engines and drive away, just as a really fast flying object makes a sonic boom and prepares its landing. It’s a bird, it’s a plane?

In his hideout, Amajagh is holding Lois as SUPERMAN breaks the ceiling and lands in front of them. Lois smiles despite being at gunpoint.

GENERAL AMAJAGH: Take one step, you will see the inside of her head.

Lois lets her hands go of the arm around her neck, smiles, Superman smiles back… and then he flies towards Amajagh, breaking down the wall behind them but leaving Lois unharmed.

Cut to black.

WOMAN (VO): The women in the village heard a noise.

Cut to CAPITOL BUILDING An African woman, Kahina Ziri, is talking in a Congressional hearing.

KAHINA: Like the sky crack open. He came down, so many dead.

We then see who is committee listening to her, led by SENATOR JUNE FINCH of Kentucky, who listens to it all with a stern look. An Asian woman in sunglasses is also among the spectators.

KAHINA: Even worse came after. The government attacked. No mercy in the villages. My parents tried to run...

Kahina starts crying and can’t talk anymore.

SENATOR FINCH: The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do, that... no one has asked what he should do. Let the record show that this committee holds him responsible.

KAHINA: He'll never answer to you. He answers to no one. Not even I think, to god.

Cut to METROPOLIS In a rainy afternoon, a taxi arrives at an APARTMENT BUILDING. Lois comes out of it, opens her mailbox, and brings her correspondence and suitcase to her apartment. Inside, she readies her bathtub, and discovers a bullet in her notepad. Afterwards, she’s taking her bath while holding the bullet. Once she hears the front door unlocking, she puts the bullet near the shampoo. CLARK KENT enters, carrying a paper bag full of flowers.

CLARK KENT: Hey.

LOIS LANE: Hey.

CLARK KENT: I was going to cook. Surprise you.

Lois tries to smile, but then scowls and speaks.

LOIS LANE: They held hearings about what happened. They're saying that...

CLARK KENT: I don't care. I don't care what they're saying. The woman I love could have been blown up or shot. Think of what could have happened.

LOIS LANE: Well, think about what did happen.

CLARK KENT: I didn't kill those men if that's what they think. If that's what you're saying.

LOIS LANE: No, I'm saying I want to understand what happened. I'm saying, thank you for saving my life. I'm saying there's a cost.

Clark puts the bag in a nearby chair, pats Lois’s head and puts his hand on her shoulder.

LOIS LANE: I just don't know if it's possible.

CLARK KENT: Don't know what's possible?

LOIS LANE: For you to love me and be you.

Clark hands her a rose that was in bag. She smiles, and then he enters the tub, standing on it and taking off his jacket.

LOIS LANE: Clark, you're going to flood the apartment.

CLARK KENT: Mmm-hmm.

He leans down to kiss her. Cut away just as his glasses fall on the floor.

GOTHAM CITY, NIGHT Bats are leaving a building’s chimney, just as police sirens are heard. The police car stops in front of the building, two cops, Mike Rucka and Mazzuccheli, enter it.

POLICE RADIO: There has been a report of screaming at location 1939 Harbor Way. Possible shots fired.

Inside, they find a Batarang stuck into one of the walls. The cops approach what seems to be a door to the basement.

They go down the stairs. Asian women are locked in a cage.

ASIAN WOMAN (SUBTITLED): It saved us. A devil.

OFFICER RUCKA: It's okay. It's okay. We're-We're going to help.

ASIAN WOMAN (SUBTITLED): It saved us.

OFFICER RUCKA: Okay, we're going to get you out of here. Okay?

He opens the door… and the frightened woman shuts it in fear. She points her finger upwards.

ASIAN WOMAN (SUBTITLED): It's still here.

OFFICER RUCKA: I - I don't understand.

A loud punch along with an “AH!” is heard upstairs, the women gasp. Rucka nods to the other, goes up to check on it.

SCARED MAN (O.S.): Please don’t, please don’t. I don’t know who he is. I don’t know who he is!

Another beating sound, followed by screams. Rucka keeps walking thorught he dark corridor, pointing his shotgun forward…

OFFICER RUCKA: Oh, fuck!

…and finds Cesar Santos, owner of the house, tied up to a radiator. Rucka turns around, feeling suspicious. Then he sees Batman lurking on the wall behind him. Frightened, he tries shooting at the vigilante, who easily evades the bullets before leaving through a hole on the ceiling. He then sees a man wielding a flashlight coming from the cellar and shoots in his direction.

OFFICER MAZZUCHELLI: Christ!

OFFICER RUCKA: I saw him. I never saw him before. I didn't know...

The angry Mazzuchelli comes to him.

OFFICER MAZZUCHELLI: You almost took my face off. How about you don't shoot the good guys, huh?

Mazzuchelli then goes to the radiator and sees Santos...

OFFICER MAZZUCHELLI: Oh, Jesus Christ.

Close-up on a bat-shaped burn scar on Santos’ chest.

OFFICER MAZZUCHELLI: He branded him.

Cut to BATCAVE

An elevator goes down, and out of it comes Bruce Wayne, who walks onward through the Batcave’s underground corridors. He passes by his butler Alfred, currently doing electrical repairs on a Bat-helmet and its microphone.

BRUCE WAYNE: You're still working? You're getting slow in your old age, Alfred.

ALFRED: Comes to us all, master Wayne. Even you got too old to die young, and not for lack of trying.

As Bruce drops his jacket and other things in front of a computer, Alfred grabs the in-helmet microphone.

ALFRED: Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry... There's nothing wrong with the microphone. It's this new layer of armor. I'll just have to rewire. So, last night was productive?

BRUCE: No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing. This is the man who knows things. Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian. Contracts all over the globe, but he's based out of the port of Gotham. Weapons and human trafficking.

ALFRED: So the White Portuguese is a Russian. That's the theory.

BRUCE: No. The theory is that the Russian will lead me to the man himself.

ALFRED: If he is, indeed, a "him." You don't even know if he exists. Could be a phantasm.

BRUCE: One that wants to bring a dirty bomb to Gotham?

ALFRED: High-stakes round. New rules.

BRUCE: We're criminals, Alfred. We've always been criminals. Nothing's changed.

ALFRED: Oh, yes, it has, sir. Everything's changed. [Shows on monitor images of Superman] Men fall from the sky. The gods hurl thunderbolts. Innocents die. That's how it starts, sir. The fever. The rage. The feeling of powerlessness. It turns good men cruel.

Cut to: APARTMENT Clark is making eggs when he sets his eyes on the television.

NEWSCASTER: Justice turned dark across the harbor, when police found an alleged sex trafficker apparently tortured and branded by the Gotham Bat. The man is the second criminal found bearing the Bat Brand. The first victim, an accused child predator, later was assaulted in prison, and remains in critical care from his injuries. One source tells Metropolis 8 that many believe the mark of the Bat Brand in prison, essentially, is a death sentence. In other news, the mayor has announced...

Cut to: LEXCORP Mercy Graves, the Asian woman seen at the congressional hearing, approaches a basketball court at the LexCorp lobby. Behind her are two senators of that committee, Finch and Barrows – and in the court in front of them is Lex Luthor, the young, long-haired CEO of the company, playing some B-ball.

PLAYER: John, get D!

Lex hits a three pointer, and turns around to find Mercy and the senators.

LEX LUTHOR: Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, Ahoy! I did not know you were here.

He approaches Barrows, who extends his hand.

SENATOR BARROWS: Man on the marquee.

LEX LUTHOR: [shaking Barrows’ hand] Yeah, don't believe it. My father named the company after himself. He was the Lex in front of the Corp. [extending his hand to June] Hi, how are you doing?

Senator Finch shakes Luthor’s hand.

SENATOR FINCH: Oh, really great.

LEX LUTHOR: Really great? Good. Good. Uh, Follow me.

A security door opens, and Luthor, now wearing a labcoat over his t-shirt, guides his visitors into the corridor.

LEX LUTHOR: You know, Dad was born in east Germany. He grew up eating uh... stale crackers. And every other Saturday, he had to march in a parade and waved flowers at tyrants. So, I think it was providence that his son, me, would end up with this.

They are now in a laboratory. The camera focuses on a glovebox, from which emerges a metallic claw holding a small green rock.

LEX LUTHOR (OS): One of my rebuild Metropolis crews found it. A little souvenir from the Kryptonian World Engine.

Senator Finch is staring at the Kryptonite, while Lex leans over the glovebox.

SENATOR FINCH: What's a rock have to do with Homeland Security?

LEX LUTHOR: Homeland Security? Mmm. No, no, no... ma'am. Planetary Security.

One scientist, Emmet, is heard explaining.

EMMET: The fragment is of a radioactive xenomineral. We suspected it might have bio-interactions, so, we took the sample to AMRIID…

He presses a nearby keyboard, the monitor changes to a video of General Zod’s corpse being removed from its plastic cover.

EMMET: Where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent.

Footage of a dentist drill-like device with the Kryptonite being used to slice Zod’s torso.

EMMET: And, when we exposed general Zod to the mineral, this happened.

June is forced to turn her back to see the monitor behind her – footage of black cells splitting up, getting a green glow and dissolving.

EMMET: Profound biodegradation, decaying Kryptonian cells.

Lex starts walking away from the glovebox.

LEX LUTHOR: We concluded the mineral could be weaponized, if a large enough sample was found. And then, among the fishes, a whale.

He points to Emmet, he presses a key, the monitor now shows the Kryptonite featured in a previous scene.

LEX LUTHOR: Ah! Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Emerald City. Beautiful. Now, Rocky is radioactive, but what he needs from you is an import license.

SENATOR FINCH: And why would we want to weaponize this material?

LEX LUTHOR: As a deterrent. A silver bullet to keep in reserve to use against the Kryptonians. So, the day doesn't come, madam, when your children are waving daisies at a reviewing stand.

SENATOR BARROWS: Last I looked, the only one of those flying around up here was Superman.

LEX LUTHOR: Ha-ha, yes. Superman. Yeah, but, there are... there are more of them.

SENATOR FINCH: The meta-human thesis.

LEX LUTHOR: Yes, the meta-human thesis. More likely than not. These exceptional beings live among us. The bases of our myths. Gods among men upon our... our little blue planet here. [he hits a small blue ball on the glovebox] You don't have to use the silver bullet. But, if you forge one... Well, then... We don't have to depend upon the kindness of monsters.

CUT TO: APARTMENT

In front of a wall-wide clipping of Superman and Bruce Wayne-related headlines and news, a man cuts a wire and duct tape and puts them in a pulley. He then pulls from the wall a picture of a family – of which the father is Wallace Keefe, the Wayne Enterprises employee saved by Bruce in Metropolis.

CUT TO: HEROES PARK

Match cut to the wheelchair bound Wallace putting the photograph of his family below a wall listing all the casualties of the Battle of Metropolis. His sad look becomes a scowl as he turns his head – and as the camera pans up, we see that the walls surround a giant statue of Superman. Wallace approaches the extended hand of the monument, takes off his jacket and grabs the thumb and pointer finger to traverse the statue with his hands. A guard notices him…

GUARD: Sir. Get down.

Wallace is now at the stone Superman’s chest.

GUARD: Sir, I said, get down! Now!

Wallace throws something at the guard, hitting a person behind him. Another security officer talks on his radio.

COP 2: Can we get some backup here?

Wallace is now shaking a spray paint can…

GUARD: Hey! Hey!

…and starts covering the statue with red graffiti.

GUARD: Don't do it! HEY!

Offices of the Daily Planet, Jenny is on the phone.

JENNY: Lois. Crime Lab, on 3.

Lois picks up the phone.

LOIS LANE: This is Lane.

Elsewhere on the room, in front of a wall of televisions, two of whom show college football news and one covering the Heroes Park events, head editor Perry White talks to Clark, who is seating nearby.

PERRY WHITE: Kent, you're sports today. I want you to follow up on the football. "Underdog dreams dashed 10 yards between Gotham and glory."

JENNY: Hey. Are you guys watching this?

She presses the remote, unmuting the TV showing the Heroes Park coverage.

REPORTER: Emergency responders quickly created a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park…

Footage of Wallace being carried away by the cops and put inside a police car.

REPORTER (VO): …while they brought the man down from this beloved monument. The suspect has been identified as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

WALLACE: I work for Bruce Wayne! I work for Bruce Wayne!

As everyone turns to see the report…

REPORTER (VO): He'll be arraigned on charges of vandalism, resisting arrest, and the felony charge of making terrorist threats. That carries up to 40 years in prison.

…now we see clearly that the Superman statue has “FALSE GOD” graffiti in its chest.

PERRY WHITE: Poor son of a bitch.

REPORTER (VO): Metropolis News 8.

PERRY WHITE: Jenny.

JENNY: Mm?

PERRY WHITE: Headline. "End of love affair with man in the sky, question mark".

JENNY: Okay.

Clark and Lois just stare silently.

Cut to LEXCORP

Senator Barrows and Lex Luthor stand in the LexCorp lobby.

SENATOR BARROWS: There are ways we can help each other.

LEX LUTHOR: Ah. Would you step into my office here?

They seat in a nearby table.

LEX LUTHOR: Yes!

SENATOR BARROWS: What's your wish list?

Lex takes a bowl of Jolly Ranchers.

LEX LUTHOR: Uh. Access to the wreck of the crashed Kryptonian ship?

SENATOR BARROWS: Done.

Cut to: METROPOLIS, EXTERIOR Aerial shot of the “sarcophagus” covering where the Fortress of Solitude fell. A car approaches it, we see that the military are heavily guarding the facility. The driver of the car, Lex, gives a permit to a sentry. We then see Lex, dressed in a blue suit and carrying a metal briefcase, going through decontamination corridors to approach the Fortress of Solitude, which is surrounded by lights and a scaffolding from which scientists observe it.

Cut to: LEXCORP

Lex taking a Jolly Rancher.

LEX LUTHOR: The complete remains of the dead alien for testing.

SENATOR BARROWS: You want Zod's body?

LEX LUTHOR: Okay.

Cut to CORRIDOR Two soldiers push a metal security box branded “USAMRIID” behind Mercy Graves. They approach Lex, who stands in front of a security door. Inside the lab, Lex has put Zod’s body in an autopsy table, and is using the Kryptonite shard to cut off one of the general’s fingerprints.

Cut to LEXCORP Lex is shoving the Jolly Rancher on the senator’s mouth.

LEX LUTHOR: It's cherry.

Cut to UNDERGROUND RING An underground fight between a White tattooed contestant and a Black one, surrounded by spectators – including Bruce Wayne, who ends up catching the African American as he falls towards the audience after a strong punch.

WOMAN: Show him what you got!

SPECTATOR: Dude, let's go!

Bruce pushes the fighter back, he positions to resume the fight.

CROWD: Make sure to hit his left. Come on. Throw a punch, will you?

Close-up on Bruce, and then on who he‘s staring at – another spectator, Anatoli.

CROWD: Let's go! Come on!

The Black guy delivers strong punches to put his opponent to his knees, and then kicks him to knock him out. Boos are heard as the winner nods towards Bruce Wayne, who nods back.

After the fight, Anatoli puts his cellphone on the table as a glass of vodka is filled for him.

ANATOLI: Thank you.

After he drinks, Bruce puts his phone on the table as well before delivering a paper to the bartender, who gives him an angry stare before leaving.

BRUCE WAYNE: The house treats luck like an insult.

ANATOLI: Good luck for one has always gives others misfortune.

Bruce then talks in subtitled Russian.

BRUCE WAYNE: But, eventually, all accounts are balanced at the end.

A surprised Anatoli turns to him.

BRUCE WAYNE: 3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina, the line was all she taught me.

ANATOLI: Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

Anatoli grabs his phone and leaves. Bruce flips his own phone, and its display reads “DEVICE CLONING SUCCESSFUL”.

Cut to DAILY PLANET Staff meeting, Perry drinks his coffee, and Clark talks.

CLARK KENT: It's like a one man reign of terror. This bat vigilante has been consistently targeting the port and the adjacent projects and tenements. And as far as I can tell the cops are actually helping him.

PERRY WHITE: "Crime wave in Gotham." Other breaking news. "Water, wet." Did you file the football yet?

CLARK KENT: Why aren't we covering this? Poor people don't buy papers?

PERRY WHITE: People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

CLARK KENT: Perry, when you assign a story, you're making a choice about who matters. And who's worth it.

PERRY WHITE: Good morning, Smallville. The America conscience died with Robert, Martin and John.

LOIS LANE (OS): Sorry. I'm sorry.

Lois enters the room carrying the bullet she took from her notebook inside a plastic bag.

LOIS LANE: No match. My guys in the crime lab, never seen one before.

Perry grabs the plastic bag, looks, and returns it.

PERRY WHITE: It's called a bullet. You shoot people with it.

LOIS LANE: Recovered from the scene of the fire fight in the desert. Not sold anywhere commercially in the world, even black market.

PERRY WHITE: So?

LOIS LANE: So, who gave prototype military rounds to tribe fighters in the Sahara?

PERRY WHITE: The Ask, Lois.

LOIS LANE: Flight to DC tonight, a couple of days there.

PERRY WHITE: Go. Coach. No extra leg room.

LOIS LANE: Economy plus.

PERRY WHITE: Coach!

CUT to LUTHOR MANSION Senator Finch is led by Mercy Graves inside Lex Luthor’s living room.

LEX LUTHOR: Senator. My dad always said that Kentucky mash was the secret to health. This was his room. I left it just the way it was. That's silly. The magical thinking of orphan boys.

SENATOR FINCH: I'm blocking the import license for your mineral.

Lex stares silently for a while before approaching the senator.

LEX LUTHOR: The Red Capes are coming! The Red Capes are coming! You and your hearings... [taps fingers on a table] galloping through the streets to warn us. One, if by land. Two, if by air.

Senator Finch grabs his hand, stopping the drumming.

LEX LUTHOR: Mmm. Do you know the oldest lie in America, Senator? Can I call you June?

SENATOR FINCH: You can call me whatever you like. Take a bucket of piss and call it Granny's Peach Tea. Take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence. You won't fool a fly or me. I'm not going to drink it.

LEX LUTHOR: Hey, you don't think dad would mind, do you? If I change just... just one thing in this room.

He turns around, shows a painting featuring demons.

LEX LUTHOR: Because, that should be upside down. Now, we know better now, don't we? The devils don't come from hell beneath us. No. No, they come from the sky.

Cut to: WAYNE MANOR

Bruce walks away from a destroyed Wayne Manor and puts flowers in his parents’ mausoleum. A closeup of MARTHA WAYNE 1946 – 1981 is seen. Blood drips from the grave, Bruce presses it with his finger… and a torrent of bats fly out of it, along with a huge bat monster who bites Bruce. A startled Bruce wakes up in his bed.

Cut to BATHROOM Swanwick is washing his hands, a woman approaches.

SWANWICK: Wrong room, miss.

LOIS LANE: Secretary Swanwick, you haven't been returning my phone calls.

SWANWICK: Miss Lane, if you like an interview, Major Farris is just outside that door.

LOIS LANE: You're treating me like a stranger?

SWANWICK: I'm treating you like a reporter.

LOIS LANE: Alright. Is the US providing experimental military arms to rebels in Africa?

SWANWICK: You know with balls like yours, you belong in here. Who's your source on this? A tin foil hat?

He starts leaving the bathroom...

LOIS LANE: No, not tin, but it's metal.

...only to turn as Lois gives him the bullet.

LOIS LANE: Fired in the Superman incident. Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it. We haven't been told the truth.

SWANWICK: Here's the truth. A reporter got greedy for a scoop and went where she shouldn't have. Superman acted like some... rogue combatant to rescue her and people died. Don't invent a conspiracy theory to put back his halo. Or yours.

He walks away, greeting Major Graves on his way out.

Cut to: WAYNE MANOR

Alfred holds a wine bottle.

ALFRED: Oh. I hope the next generation of Waynes won't inherit an empty wine cellar. Not that there's likely to be a next generation...

Bruce approaches, puts a cup in the table.

ALFRED: Thank you, sir.

Alfred then starts taking papers from a sheaf, as Bruce fiddles with a laptop.

BRUCE WAYNE: This is every call made from the Russian's phone. Two mentions of business with the "White Portuguese" and it's continuing transmitting black out data to the personal residence of Alexander Luthor.

ALFRED: You think Lex Luthor is the "White Portuguese"? I can't see that he needs the income from imported arms.

BRUCE WAYNE: Regardless, I'll need to put a 'leech' in his house, and I'm going to need the suit.

ALFRED: The Bat interrogated 6 people and came away with nothing. It was Bruce Wayne that got the information.

BRUCE WAYNE: Well, Bruce Wayne can't break into Lex Luthor's house.

ALFRED: Bruce Wayne won't have to. [hands over an envelope to Bruce] He's been invited.

Bruce sees an invitation for a cocktail at Lex Luthor’s mansion.

At the Batcave, Bruce stares at the Batsuit – and then passes by the Robin suit behind a glass cage, covered in graffiti reading “HA HA HA Joke's on you BATMAN”. He then climbs the stairs back to his house. Outside, Bruce takes an Aston Martin and drives away, passing by the destroyed Wayne Manor along the way.

CUT TO OUTSIDE LUTHOR MANSION, NIGHT Bruce Wayne’s Aston Martin arrives, reporters chatter. - That's him right there! - There he is! Get a shot! - Bruce, over here! - Bruce, Bruce. - Wayne, have a shot. - Mr. Wayne! - Right here, one second. - This way, Mr. Wayne!

Clark Kent sees the uproar, turns to a nearby photographer.

CLARK KENT: Who's that?

PHOTOGRAPHER: You must be new to the let them eat cake beat. That is Bruce Wayne.

CUT TO INSIDE THE MANSION

Library president Nicky LeBlanc talks in a microphone.

NICKY: Philanthropist. Bibliophile. True friend of the library of Metropolis. Mr. Lex Luthor.

Applause as the path is cleared for Lex to hit the stage.

LEX LUTHOR: Me? Ah. Okay. Nicky. You're embarrassing me.

As Lex readies himself, a stunning brunette, DIANA, is offered a drink but refuses. While looking back, she and Bruce stare at each other for a while before she looks forward again.

LEX LUTHOR: Speech. Speech. Uh, blah blah blah. Open bar. The end. The word Philanthropist, comes from the Greek. Meaning a lover of humanity. It was coined about, 2,500 years ago.

Bruce, clearly with other plans, talks to a hidden earpiece.

BRUCE WAYNE: Alright, where am I going, Alfred?

In the Batcave, Alfred looks at a digital schematic of the mansion. Bruce is represented by a blue line.

ALFRED: Go past the elevator, do a left.

Back in the Luthor home, Clark is clearly listening to the conversation with his enhanced hearing, turning around to see Bruce.

ALFRED (VO): That where it must be. It's in the service corridor in the basement. Go down the stairs.

LEX LUTHOR: Prometheus went with us, and he ruined Zeus' plan to destroy mankind and for that, he was given a thunderbolt. Chooo! Hm. That seems unfair. On the serious note, the library of Metropolis...

Bruce continues walking forward.

ALFRED: Down the stairs. It's the only way in, down the stairs. He passes by Mercy Graves, who looks suspiciously.

LEX LUTHOR (OS): But, at one time, Dad could not either. No, my father could not afford the books, so... He had to root through the garbage for yesterday's newspaper.

Bruce has walked down the stairs, passing by waiters…

ALFRED: Now you got the kitchens on your right.

ALFRED (VO): Do a left.

The mansion schematics has a highlighted room near where Bruce is.

ALFRED: Right in front of you, that's where you want to be.

A room full of servers. Bruce has just plugged in his hacking device when Mercy shows up at the door.

MERCY GRAVES: May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

BRUCE WAYNE: Uh, I just... thought the bathroom was down here. I must have... That last Martini was a... two too many, I think.

MERCY GRAVES: Men's room is upstairs.

BRUCE WAYNE: Great, I'm okay. I like those shoes.

She smiles and leaves while talking to a cook who approached her. Bruce talks to Alfred again.

BRUCE WAYNE: I can't stay down here, Alfred.

ALFRED: Go upstairs and socialize. Some young lady from Metropolis will make you honest. [to himself] In your dreams, Alfred.

Upstairs, people are still in disbelief of the nonsense Lex is spewing.

LEX LUTHOR: Books are knowledge, and knowledge is power. And I am... Heh heh heh, no. I, umm. No, what am I? What was I saying? No. The bitter sweet pain among man is having knowledge with no power. Because... Because that is paradoxical! And umm...Thank you for coming. Please, drink, it's free.

Applause for Lex, as “Night and Day” plays, Bruce enters the room while taking the last glass of Martini from a passing waiter, and Diana goes in another direction as he sees him coming closer. Clark then approaches.

CLARK KENT: Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne? Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

BRUCE WAYNE: Oh, my foundation has already issued a statement in support of the... books.

CLARK KENT: Sir?

BRUCE WAYNE: Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit. Don't quote me, alright?

CLARK KENT: What's your position on the bat vigilante in Gotham?

BRUCE WAYNE: Daily Planet. Wait, do I own this one? Or was that the other guy?

CLARK KENT: Civil liberties has been trampled on in your city. Good people living in fear.

BRUCE WAYNE: Don't believe everything you hear, son.

CLARK KENT: I've seen it, Mr. Wayne. He thinks he's above the law.

BRUCE WAYNE: The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they're above the law is a little hypocritical, wouldn't you say? Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree, you write a puff piece editorial, about an alien who, if he wanted to, could burn the whole place down. There wouldn't be a damn thing we can do to stop him.

CLARK KENT: Most of the world doesn't share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

BRUCE WAYNE: Maybe it's the Gotham City in me, we just have a bad history with freaks dressed like clowns.

Lex Luthor arrives.

LEX LUTHOR: Boys! Mm, Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ah, I love it! I love bringing people together! How are we?

BRUCE WAYNE: Lex.

LEX LUTHOR: Hello, good. [turns to Clark, extends hand] Hi, hello. Lex. It is a pleasure... [Clark presses his hand] Ow! Wow, that is a good grip! You should, not pick a fight with this person. Ha! So, after all these years, we've finally got you over to Metropolis.

BRUCE WAYNE: Well, I thought I come drink you dry.

LEX LUTHOR: Well, you're welcome. You should hop the hub more often though, I love to show you my labs. Maybe we could, be partner on something. My R&D is up to all sorts of no good.

As Mercy approaches Lex from behind, we cut to the basement – the hacking device is finishing its countdown.

In the Batcave, the monitor reads “TRANSFER COMPLETE”

ALFRED: That's 7 minutes. Look likes the transfer's complete.

Clark is again tickled by the hidden conversation, as he and Bruce exchange uncomfortable looks.

MERCY GRAVES: Mr. Luthor.

LEX LUTHOR: Yes.

MERCY GRAVES: The governor.

LEX LUTHOR: Governor. Excuse me.

BRUCE WAYNE: Next time.

Bruce leaves, Lex turns to the bigwig.

LEX LUTHOR: Governor, hi.

GOVERNOR: Lex, it's good to see you.

Clark then turns to see where Bruce went and walks after him.

CUT TO LUTHOR MANSION, BASEMENT STAIRS Bruce Wayne is walking down, Clark Kent not far behind. When Bruce is getting near the server room again, Clark is distracted by a Telemundo report, which is also startling the cooks and waiters nearby.

MEXICAN REPORTER: (VO, SUBTITLED) "... A deadly factory fire has interrupted the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez."

In the server room, the hacking device is absent. Bruce turns around, Diana is at the door. As she walks away, he runs towards her.

BRUCE WAYNE: Excuse me.

Bruce continues to walk in the direction of the woman in the red dress, bumping by waiters and guests. Downstairs, the Mexican disaster fire is still on TV.

MEXICAN REPORTER (VO, SUBTITLE): "I can't believe they're going to let that poor girl die."

Clark adjusts his tie and walks away.

CUT TO OUTSIDE MANSION Bruce sees Diana enter a car and drive away. Frustration and annoyance fill his face.

CUT TO JUAREZ As the factory crumbles, Superman glides down carrying the girl who was trapped in the fire. The people watching take out their hats in reverence. As he kneels before a happy woman to deliver her daughter back, the crowd, many of whom are dressed in Dia de los Muertos skull make-up, extend their hands in adoration. We start to hear a voice-over, which turns out to be a television segment of “In the Moment News” , “The Superman Question”, currently featuring the opinion of filmmaker Vikram Gandhi.

VIKRAM GANDHI (VO): We, as a population on this planet, have been looking for a savior. 90% of people believe in a higher power. And every religion believes in some sort messianic figure. And when this savior character actually comes to Earth, we want to make him abide by our rules? We have to understand that this is a paradigm shift. We have to start thinking beyond politics.

As Superman drags a stranded boat in the Arctic by its anchor, author Andrew Sullivan is talking to GBS with the caption “Superman’s Actions are Political”.

ANDREW SULLIVAN (VO): Are there any moral constraints on this person? We have international law. On this Earth, every act is a political act.

On PBS, Charlie Rose is interviewing Senator Finch.

CHARLIE ROSE: Is it really surprising, that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy?

SENATOR FINCH: To have an individual engaging in the state level interventions should give us all pause.

As Superman saves a spaceship after its rocket explodes on liftoff, blogger Glen Woodburn talks to Metropolis News, Channel 8.

GLEN WOODBURN: Human beings have a horrible track record of following people with great power, down paths that lead to huge human monstrosities. We have always created icons in our own image. What we've done is we project ourselves on to him. The fact is, maybe he's not some sort of devil or Jesus character. Maybe he's just a guy trying to do the right thing.

In the same segment where Vikram Gandhi has spoken, physicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson speaks. In-between, amidst a flood, the people on the ceiling of a house have painted the Superman shield. They amusingly look into the sky as Superman floats nearby, showing he has come to their rescue.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON (VO): Were talking about a being whose very existence challenges our own sense of priority in the universe. If you go back to Copernicus, where he restored the sun and the center of the known universe, displacing Earth. And you get to Darwinian evolution and you find out, we're not special on this Earth we're just one among other life forms. And now we learned, that we're not even special in the entire universe because there is Superman. There he is, an alien, among us. We're not alone.

CHARLIE ROSE (VO): Are you, as a United State Senator, personally comfortable saying to a grieving parent, "Superman could've saved your child, but on principle we did not want him to act."

SENATOR FINCH: I'm not saying he shouldn't act. I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.

CHARLIE ROSE: What are we talking about here then? Must there be a Superman?

SENATOR FINCH: There is.

We discover this PBS broadcast is being watched by Clark, who looks a bit frustrated.

CUT TO PRISON A guard approaches the cell of Wallace Keefe, currently imprisoned for vandalizing Superman’s statue.

GUARD: Keefe, you made bail. Open Two.

As the cell door opens, Wallace asks…

WALLACE: Who paid?

CUT to OUTSIDE HOUSE Mercy Graves sits on the hood of a car, as Wallace rides his wheelchair towards his home.

CUT to INSIDE WALLACE’S HOME Wallace is going to his living room, notices someone already there.

WALLACE: Who the hell are you?

Lex Luthor turns around in an automatic wheelchair.

LEX LUTHOR: Just a man.

WALLACE: Yeah? Well, what do you want?

Lex leaves the wheelchair.

LEX LUTHOR: To help you stand for something.

Wallace then stares at the wheelchair, knowing it has been given to him.

CUT to SENATOR FINCH’S OFFICE As the Senator enters her office, her receptionist delivers a paper sheaf.

RECEPTIONIST: Your 3 o'clock's here.

In the office, Wallace, wearing a suit, turns around in the automated wheelchair as he hears June approaching. They stare before he speaks.

WALLACE: He made me half a man. Let me face him.

PERRY WHITE: So, I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

Perry, talking to Clark, opens up a mockup of a sports page – the headline story about football with blank text.

PERRY WHITE: There's copy, alright. But, nothing about football. Nothing about... [Perry rips the paper] Friends of the Metropolis Library, just... The god damn Gotham bat thing, I told you not to pursue.

CLARK KENT: If the police won't help, the press has to do the right thing.

PERRY WHITE: You don't get to decide what the right thing is.

CLARK KENT: When the Planet was founded, it stood for something, Perry.

PERRY WHITE: So could you, if it was 1938, but it's not 1938. WPA ain't hiring no more. Apples don't cost a nickel. Not in here. Not out there. You drop this thing! Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman.

CUT TO MANSION Diana, in her job as an antiques dealer, is shown an ancient sword while visiting a mansion.

RICH GUY: It's the sword of Alexander. It's the blade that cut the Gordian Knot. It's a triumph.

DIANA: Yes.

RICH GUY: Enjoy.

DIANA: Thank you.

As Diana stares at the sword, Bruce comes from behind her.

BRUCE WAYNE: It's a fake. The real was sold in '98 on the black market. Now it hangs...

DIANA: Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar. Excuse me.

Diana tries to walk away, but Bruce grabs her by the arm.

BRUCE WAYNE: Excuse me, Miss. The other night, you took something that doesn't belong to you. Stealing's not polite.

DIANA: Is it stealing if you steal from another thief?

BRUCE WAYNE: Who are you?

DIANA: Someone interested in the same man you are.

BRUCE WAYNE: Is that right?

DIANA: I believe Mr. Luthor has a photo that belongs to me.

BRUCE WAYNE: Did you get it?

DIANA: As it happens, no, I didn't. The data you copied is military grade encryption.

BRUCE WAYNE: You know. I bet with that dress 9 out of 10 men would let you get away with anything.

DIANA: But, you're the 10th.

BRUCE WAYNE: Mmm. I guess I am the first, to see through that babe in the woods act. You don't know me, but, I've known a few women like you.

DIANA: Oh, I don't think you've ever known a woman like me. You know, it's true what they say about little boys: Born with no natural inclination to share. I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it. You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car. Mr. Wayne.

She then walks away, Bruce stares.

Cut to BATCAVE

Bruce connects the drive to a computer, the screen reads [INITIATING DECRYPTION]. As the decryption is on 2%, we cut to black… …and a metal door opens. A visibly more aged Batman steps out of it, in desert clothing over his cowl.

Cut to RUINS The door was that of a stone bunker in a seemingly desertic location, covered in ruins and barbed wire. Pillars of fire similar to volcanoes surround the area. Batman looks through a pair of binoculars. A fleet of truck arrives in the ruin compound. Batman approaches a truck as its back door opens.

BATMAN: Did you get it? The rock?

MAN: Yeah, we got it.

Batman enters the truck, opens a LexCorp box, and finds only green light bulbs.

MAN (pointing a gun at Batman): I'm sorry.

Stormtroopers with Superman’s shield as shoulder patches reveal themselves to Batman and his allies.

TROOPERS: Get down! Get down! Now!

Another soldier points his rifle at Batman. He holds his hands up, and by turning around sees his men being executed.

BATMAN: NOOOOO!

Angered, he begins a killing spree, gunning down and brutally beating the multiple stormtroopers working for Superman. Although he manages to take down most of the stormtroopers while Parademons invade the area and abduct many of his resistance fighters, Batman is eventually overwhelmed by the remaining stormtroopers there who could barely restrain him. He snaps one of their necks but then is brutally (but barely) beaten down and restrained by the other stormtroopers. Seeing the damage that Batman was inflicting on the stormtroopers and their inability to restrain him, a Parademon knocks him unconscious.

Cut to UNDERGROUND BUNKER

Batman recuperates chained up in the bunker with his remaining allies, eyeing them helplessly. Superman himself then lands in the bunker, and his stormtroopers reverently bow before their leader. He approaches Batman, swiftly murdering the latter's other allies with his heat vision. Superman then unmasks the infuriated vigilante.

SUPERMAN: She was my world. And you took her from me.

Superman then rips out Batman's heart.

BATMAN: GGAAHHHHH!

CUT TO: BATCAVE Bruce awoke from this nightmare to find a distorted and unstable blue portal of electricity right in front of him. Inside it is a mysterious time traveler...

FLASH: Bruce! Bruce! Listen to me now! It's Lois! It's Lois Lane! She's the key! Am I too soon? DAMN! I'm too soon! You're right about him! You've always been right about him! Fear him! Fear him! Find us, Bruce! You have to find us... find us...!

Bruce wakes up again. That was all a dream. The computer reads DECRYPTING [100%] - [DECRYPTION COMPLETE] before opening a LexCorp branded interface.

Cut to DAILY PLANET Clark Kent is typing on his computer when he is delivered an envelope. Inside there is a cutout of the “BAT BRAND OF JUSTICE!” newspaper Alfred had shown Bruce, and four Polaroid pictures of the captured man with the captions “JUDGE”, “Jury”, “EXECUTIONER”, “JUSTICE?”

In-between, the movie cuts to the BATCAVE, where Bruce searches for “White Portuguese” in the LexCorp program. He eventually finds pictures and locations of a ship, harbored in Gotham.

Bruce checks around the cave as Alfred fiddles with the Batmobile’s engine.

BRUCE WAYNE: The "WHITE PORTUGUESE" is not a man. It's a ship.

ALFRED: Master Wayne. Since the age of 7, you have been to the art of deception as Mozart to the harpsichord. But you've never been too hot of lying to me. The WHITE PORTUGUESE isn't carrying a dirty bomb. What is it carrying?

BRUCE WAYNE: It's a weapon. It's a rock. A mineral, capable of weakening Kryptonian cells. The first sample big enough to mean something turned up in the Indian Ocean 3 months ago. It is now aboard the White Portuguese being delivered to Lex Luthor. Who I am going to steal it from.

ALFRED: To keep it out of Luthor's hands. To destroy it.

BRUCE WAYNE: No.

ALFRED: You're going to go to war?

BRUCE WAYNE: That son of a bitch brought the war to us, 2 years ago. Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead. Thousands of people. What's next? Millions? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race and if we believe there is even a 1% chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty. And we have to destroy him.

ALFRED: But, he is not our enemy.

BRUCE WAYNE: Not today. 20 years in Gotham, Alfred. We've seen what promises are worth. How many good guys are left. How many stay that way.

Cut to DC Lois Lane stands in a rainy alleyway, waiting for Swanwick.

LOIS LANE: I don't have a halo over me, Mr. Secretary. I went into the desert, people died. It keeps me awake. It should.

She hands him the bag with the bullet.

LOIS LANE: If you think Superman is a murderer then throw it away. But, I don't believe you think that.

Swanwick walks away.

Cut to GOTHAM HARBOR Aboard the White Portuguese, Anatoli Knyazev and his men take a crate out of the ship. The camera pans up a nearby crane, and Batman is standing on top of it with a rifle. The crate is loaded onto a LexCorp truck, as Batman watches from the rifle scope.

ANATOLI: Move out!

After Anatoli closes the back door, Batman fires a homing beacon onto it. The thugs who had just closed the door run towards their vehicles to escort the truck. Just as they leave the port, one of the thugs on the backseat of a car notes the Batmobile is waiting outside.

THUG: Go, go, go, go!

As the thug grabs a machine gun and fires it into the Batmobile’s direction once his car starts moving, Batman crashes into a car, hurling it into a portable trailer. Batman then fires his harpoon launcher at the car and drags it behind him, slamming it into walls and barriers. After chasing down the enemy vehicle who keeps on firing, he detaches the harpoon…

THUG: No!

…and lets the crushed car crash onto the other. As the Batmobile was catching up to the convoy, another car fired at the Batmobile with a gatling gun. Unfazed, Batman fired his own guns back, eventually destroying the car. Eventually, the truck itself opens, revealing Anatoli with a rocket launcher. The Batmobile continues to chase after the convoy until it takes a turn after seeing an incoming tanker truck – which the car in front of him doesn’t, crashing and causing a massive explosion. The Batmobile maneuvers its way around warehouses…

ANATOLI: Where is he?

...and lands on top of the convoy, crashing through the roof (narrowly missing Anatoli) and through several docked boats. Nevertheless, Batman continues to chase after the convoy, deploying flares to ward off homing missiles. Suddenly, as he is turning a corner, he crosses paths with Superman. The Batmobile collides against Superman and crashes into a nearby gas station. Superman remains steady, and tears the roof off the vehicle to confront the vigilante directly as Batman stood up in defiance.

SUPERMAN: Next time they shine your light in the sky, don't go to it. The Bat is dead. Bury it. Consider this mercy.

Superman starts to walk away.

BATMAN: Tell me. [Superman looks at Batman] Do you bleed?

Superman flies away as Batman keeps staring at him.

BATMAN: You will.

The Batmobile runs all the way back to the Batcave. Bruce, now without his cowl, approaches a monitor and presses a button. The screen starts blinking “SEARCHING FOR TRANSPONDER SIGNAL” before marking the location as “LEXCORP RESEARCH PARK”. There, Lex opens the case and a green glow covers his face.

Cut to CAPITOL Senator Finch, Wallace by her side, talks to the press. At a certain point, this broadcast is seen being watched by Lois in her taxi and Clark in the Daily Planet press room.

SENATOR FINCH: How do we determine what's good? In a democracy, good is a conversation not a unilateral decision. So, I urge Superman, to come to this hearing of the people tomorrow. To see those who have suffered. The world needs to know what happened in that desert. And to know what he stands for. How far will he take his power? Does he act by our will, or by his own?

In the LexCorp labs, Lex Luthor stares at the huge Kryptonite rock inside the glovebox.

Cut to SMALLVILLE (NIGHT) Martha Kent talks to Clark.

MARTHA KENT: People hate what they don't understand. But they see what you do, and they know who you are. You're not a killer. A threat. I never wanted this world to have you. Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument. Be their angel. Be anything they need you to be. Or be none of it. You don't owe this world a thing. You never did.

Cut to DC (MORNING) Swanwick and Lois are sitting in a bench by the river.

SWANWICK: CI thinks the desert was a setup. Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

LOIS LANE: The bullet?

Flashback to the desert events, before Swanwick returns the bullet.

SWANWICK: The metal was developed by a private company.

LOIS LANE: What company?

SWANWICK: LEXCORP.

LOIS LANE: Lex Luthor?

SWANWICK: He also had private security contractors in the desert compound.

Lois remembers Anatoli.

LOIS LANE: Go on record.

SWANWICK: Not a chance. It's classified. I happen to like my job.

LOIS LANE: It doesn't make sense. You said that the ambush was arranged to frame Superman, but how could they know that he'll show up in the...

Flashback, Superman arriving to rescue Lois.

LOIS LANE: ...in the middle of the desert. Thank you.

Lois runs away.

GUARD: Alright, Come on through.

SOLEDAD O’BRIEN: The Senate hearing is expected to get under way in any minute now. Of course the big unknown in all of this is: Will Superman show up? That is what they're really waiting to see. Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe. Soledad O'Brien, "In the Moment". Quick question for you. You're heading in to meet with the senators. What would you tell them?

In the Wayne Enterprises meeting room, Bruce is watching this broadcast.

WALLACE: Um. I've come here to tell them to wake up. This is flesh and blood. He's delivered a war here. And this... (points to his amputated legs) This is what war looks like. I have nothing.

SOLEDAD: There are plenty of people, sir, who would say he's their hero.

WALLACE: He is not a hero!

BRUCE WAYNE: Grace, can you get Greg up here please, right now.

Cut to CAPITOL, CORRIDOR Senator Finch and her cohorts are walking down the hallway.

LEX LUTHOR: Senator! Hi, you. Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you. You know what? [turns to…] Mercy? You go in and...make sure no one takes my seat.

SENATOR FINCH: So, what'd you been up to?

LEX LUTHOR: I'm just here to tell my story. That I was willing to finance a Kryptonian deterrent, but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky decided to block it. Yes, the Chair of the Committee on Superman is soft on security.

In the Wayne HQ, Greg approaches Bruce with a stack of papers.

BRUCE WAYNE: Greg, why hasn't he been getting our checks?

GREG: He is, Mr. Wayne. He gets a check from the victims fund every month. He returns them. Bruce sees the first paper, with an attached check onto which “BRUCE WAYNE, OPEN YOUR EYES” was scribbled in red ink.

SOLEDAD (VO): An employee of Wayne financial who lost both his legs in those horrific events in Metropolis that happened 2 years ago.

The next paper reads “Bruce, NO TRUCE”…

BRUCE: Jesus. …and then “B WAYNE, I HAUNT YOU”, “ BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND”…

BRUCE: Why haven't I seen this?

GREG: I'm sorry. I'll get to the bottom of it.

In DC, the crowd is ecstatic as something approaches from the sky.

SOLEDAD: (VO) And there he is. Superman is here. He's actually at the United States Capitol. This is really a historic moment.

Martha Kent is seeing the broadcast from the diner where she works as an waitress. Seeing her son makes her worried.

SOLEDAD: (VO) Nor we expect that Superman would give some kind of a statement to the Senate to the American people, and of course to the world.

Inside the capitol, Senator Barrows gets a text message.

SENATOR BARROWS: He's here. He came. He's above the Capitol.

LEX LUTHOR: Ow. You are going to be on the hot seat in there, Junebug.

June puts on her coat.

SENATOR FINCH: I grew up on a farm. I know how to wrestle a pig.

LEX LUTHOR: Do you know the oldest lie in America, Senator? It's that power can be innocent. Good luck.

June and Barrows walk towards the auditorium.

Cut to OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL A cop tries to stop Lois, before she shows her press pass and lets her go. Lois eventually gets by the barricade separating the people from the Capitol stairs, where Superman lands. The crowd is divisive: along with supporters with “Superman Saves” shirts and chanting his name, there are angry people screaming “Get out!” and holding signs reading things such as “SUPERMAN=ILLEGAL ALIEN”, ”THIS IS OUR WORLD, NOT YOURS!”, “EARTH BELONGS TO HUMANS”,”GOD HATES ALIENS”, “GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!”, “WHEN INVASION BECOMES REALITY, REVOLT BECOMES DUTY!”.

Greg hands another envelope as Bruce watches Superman on TV.

Cut to: SENATE As June talks to Senator Purrington, Superman enters the room walking. He goes to the defendant's post.

SENATOR FINCH: Let me say at the outset that I am grateful to our witness for coming before us today.

Superman notes Wallace on the corner.

SENATOR FINCH: This is how a democracy works. We talk to each other. We act by the consent of the govern, sir, I have sat here before to say that shadow interventions will not tolerate by this Committee.

Mercy notes Lex still hasn’t arrive.

SENATOR FINCH: Neither will lies. Because today is a day for truth. Because only by speaking...

She turns the jar, it is labeled "GRANNY'S PEACH TEA". Once June notes Lex Luthor's chair is empty, her shock enhances.

SENATOR FINCH: Oh, my God!

Wallace's wheelchair explodes, destroying most of the Capitol.

Reaction shots of the startled crowd outside seeing the fireball, Martha Kent dropping her coffee pot upon hearing the explosion on the TV, and ultimately Lois Lane in the middle of the crowd (where a police horse is scared). Superman is eventually shown intrigued in the middle of the inferno.

Cut to WAYNE ENTERPRISES  REPORTER (VO): We're back at the nation's capitol where something is happening.

As Bruce sees the destruction on TV, he opens the envelope. Inside there's a newspaper "WAYNE TOWER DEVASTATED" with red text written on it, "YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE". Bruce gets angry. Cut to black.

Cut to LEXCORP Police surround the headquarters, where the firemen are trying to put out the fire on the entry post and EMTs take out the injured. Lex arrives in a motorcycle, walks past the corridor filled with bullet shells, and after going through the laboratory’s broken glass doors, sees that the glovebox has been opened, with the Kryptonite replaced by a Batarang.

Cut to DC HOTEL Lois is watching the news…

She turns it off when seeing Superman is waiting in the balcony.

REPORTER (VO): ...gotten explosive device into the hearing by concealing them inside his wheelchair. As for Superman, he was in the room, but obviously failed to stop him.

Lois opens the door to the outside.

SUPERMAN: I didn't see it, Lo. Standing right there and I didn't see it.

LOIS LANE: Clark, there are people behind this.

SUPERMAN: I'm afraid I didn't see it because I wasn't looking. All this time. I've been living my life the way my father saw it. Righting wrongs for a ghost. Thinking I'm here to do good. Superman was never real. Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

LOIS LANE: That farmer's dream is all some people have. It's all that gives them hope. [presses the insignia on Superman's chest] This means something.

SUPERMAN: It did on my world. My world doesn't exist anymore. He flies away.

Cut to OUTSIDE KRYPTONIAN SHIP A briefcase is opened. Petri dishes with fingerprints are taken out – General Zod’s, which Lex has put on his own fingers to press the “lock” on the ship’s door. It opens.

Cut to INSIDE KRYPTONIAN SHIP Lex enters the flooded ship, and eventually finds a port where Superman’s command key lies. He makes it enter the “key port” again, and reactivates the ship.

SHIP PA: Wel.. Wel... come... Welcome. Analysis revealing ship operating at 37% efficiency. Would you, like to assume command?

LEX LUTHOR: Yes, I would. Yes, I would.

SHIP PA: Very well. Let's begin. The Kryptonian archives contains knowledge from 100,000 different worlds.

LEX LUTHOR: Good. Teach me.

Intercut with scenes of Bruce Wayne exercising to build up muscle –beating up and dragging a tire, lifting while carrying chained metal balls, bench pressing an enormous amont of weight – are scenes of him checking all about the Kryptonite on the LexCorp software, and operating a laser to cut shards of the rock. The end results include Kryptonite vapor stored in bullets resembling shotgun shells and a Kryptonite spear. Afterwards, a tired Bruce is checking the software again, and picks a folder named “META-HUMAN”. The resulting window has four icons. He picks the first, resembling two Ws (Subject: WW). The first file, “2012Central IMPOR”, is a picture of Diana outside a bank in Paris. The second, “SURVEILLANCEMBANK”, shows CCTV footage in Paris, three years later, of Diana taking money from an ATM and being checked by a facial software once she lifts her head. Bruce, already intrigued, then goes for the last file, “BELGIUM, NOVEMBER 1918”. The result is a black-and-white picture of a World War I squad, with Diana in some sort of armor in the center. A startled Bruce pushes his back towards the chair and wonders what he is seeing.

CUT TO FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE Lex Luthor is opening General Zod’s body bag.

SHIP PA: Alexander Luthor, your security override has been accepted. Genesis Chamber ready to analyze genetic sample.

Lex drags Zod’s corpse into the flooded chamber.

SHIP PA: Acknowledging presence of genetic material. Analyzing. I've identified the host as General Zod of Kandor.


Lex puts his hands around Zod’s face, and then takes a knife to slice his hand. The blood drips from his hand onto Zod’s face.

SHIP PA: Acknowledging presence of foreign genetic material. Analyzing.

LEX LUTHOR: Oh. You flew too close to the sun. Now look at you.

As the corpse sinks and is taken by mechanical arms at the bottom of the chamber…

SHIP PA: Advising. Action forbidden. It is been decreed by the Council of Krypton that none will ever again give life to a deformity. So hateful to sighted memory. The desecration without name. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads

LEX LUTHOR: And where is the Council of Krypton?

PERRY WHITE: Still no Kent?

JENNY: "His disappearance raises questions."

LOIS LANE: No.

JENNY: "How could he simply have disappeared at a time when we, as a nation, need him more than ever?"

Lois then sees on TV a report titled “WAS SUPERMAN INVOLVED?”, where a crowd screams “Burn him! Burn him!” while effigies of him are torched down.

CUT TO MOUNTAINS As Clark hikes along a mountain range, he eventually finds his father, Jonathan Kent, making up a pile of rocks out of the rubble in the ground.

PA KENT: Something, isn't it? We met Kansas, live on a pancake so we come to the mountains. All downhill from here. Down to the flood plain. The farm is at the bottom of the world. I remember one season water came bad. I could've been 12. Dad had out the shovels and we went at it all night. We worked until I think I fainted. But we managed to stop the water. We saved the farm. Your grandma baked me a cake. She said I was a hero. Later that day we found out. We blocked the water, alright, we sent it upstream. The whole Lang farm washed away. While eating my hero cake, their horses were drowning. I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

SUPERMAN: Did the nightmares ever stop?

PA KENT: Yeah. When I met your mother, she gave me faith that there is good in this world. She was my world. I miss you, son.

SUPERMAN: I miss you too, Dad.

A wide shot shows Clark is all alone by the pile of rocks.

BRUCE WAYNE: I'm older now than my father ever was. This maybe the only thing I do that matters.

ALFRED: 20 years of fighting criminals amount to nothing?

BRUCE WAYNE: Criminals are like weeds, Alfred. Pull one up, another grows in it's place. This is about the future of the world. It's my legacy.

Close-up on the Wayne family crest near the fireplace.

BRUCE WAYNE: You know, my father sat me down, right here. Told me what Wayne manor was built of.

ALFRED: Railways, real estates and oil.

BRUCE WAYNE: The first generation made their fortune trading with the French. Pelts and skins. They were hunters.

Bruce then walks out the mansion.

Cut to DINER Martha Kent is readying up to leave her job while watching TV.

REPORTER: We got to wait for more evidence, but the question still remains, where is he? If Superman was not involved, If he's got nothing to hide, then why hasn't he been seen since the day of this tragedy?

INTERVIEWEE: Look, you can't...

Martha turns off the TV. Through the back door, she takes out the day’s trash, and just as she puts it in a dumpster, a nearby car starts and turns its headlights on her. Suspicious, Martha tries walking away – only to be stopped by an arriving van. She turns around to see the car as the vehicle opens. From it, two men get out, grab Martha and drag her into the van.

Cut to GOTHAM A rainy night. Batman now wears an armored suit, with flashing eyes. In a wrecked building, he takes the Kryptonite and stabs it on the ground. Amidst the rain and thunder, he then turns on the Batsignal and stands besides it as it flashes his emblem on the sky.

LEX LUTHOR: The night is here.

LOIS: Excuse me, don't I know --

The man turns out to be Anatoli.

LEX LUTHOR: Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks. Lois Lane. Mmm. Come see the view. Um... Mmm-mmm. Now the secret to the height is the building material. It's light metals which sway a bit in the wind. Hmm. And you know something about Lexcorp metals, don't you, Miss Lane?

LOIS: I've proven what you've done. 

LEX LUTHOR: Wow, you're feisty. Unfortunately, that will blow away. Like sand in the desert.

LOIS: You're psychotic.

LEX LUTHOR: That is a three-syllable word for any thought too big for little minds. Hmm. Next category: circles. Round and round and round they go to find Superman. Wrong category, boy. No, no, triangles. Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality. The shortest distance between any two points is a straight path. And I believe the straightest path to Superman is a pretty little road. Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

Lex pushes Lois off the roof, before she could plummet to her death, she was saved by Superman.

LOIS: You came back. You came back.

Superman puts Lois on the ground before flying back up.

LEX LUTHOR: Boy, do we have problems up here! [Putting away egg timer] The problem of...of evil in the world. The problem of absolute virtue.

SUPERMAN: I'll take you in without breaking you. Which is more than you deserve.

LEX LUTHOR: The problem with you on top of everything else. You above all. Because that's what God is. Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El. Clark Joseph Kent. See, what we call God depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe. Because God is tribal. God takes sides. No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm. I figured out way back, if God is all-powerful, he cannot be all-good. And if he is all-good, he cannot be all-powerful. And neither can you be. They need to see the fraud you are. With their eyes. The blood on your hands.

SUPERMAN: What have you done?

LEX LUTHOR: Hmm. And tonight, they will. Yes. because you, my friend, have a date. Hmm. Across the bay. Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing. But it did not take much to push him over, actually. Little red notes, big bang. You let your family die! And now you will fly to him. And you will battle him. To the death. Black and blue. Fight night! The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world. God versus man. [thunder rumbles] Day versus night. Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

SUPERMAN: You think I'll fight him for you?

LEX LUTHOR: Hmm, yes, I do. I think you will fight-fight-fight for that special lady in your life.

SUPERMAN: She's safe of the ground. How about you?

LEX LUTHOR: Close, but I am not talking about Lois. No. Every boy's special lady is his mother. (Shows pictures of Martha Kent injured) Martha, Martha, Martha. Hmm. Why, the mother of the flying demon must be a witch. The punishment for witches, what is that? That's right. Death by fire. Mmm. 

SUPERMAN: (heat vision powered up) Where is she?

LEX LUTHOR: I don't know! I would not let them tell me! Now, if you kill me, Martha dies. If you fly away, mmm, Martha also dies. But if you kill the Bat, Martha lives. There we go. There we go. Hmm. And now God bends to my will. Oooh, now the cameras are waiting for you at your ship. For the world to see the holes in the holy. Yes, the Almighty comes clean about how dirty he is when it counts. To save Martha, bring me the head of the Bat. Ah. Mother of God, would you look at the time? When you came here you had an hour. Now it's less. (Gets in helicopter and flies away)

ANDERSON COOPER: CNN's own Brooke Baldwin is at the scene. brooke, you're love on the air. What do you see?

BROOKE BALDWIN: It's sending massive power surges.

ERIKA ERICKSON: Police helicopters surrounding the area. They've created a barricade around the containment center. And we're trying to get a little bit closer here to find out what's going on. It is absolute chaos. You can see that lightning, those surges of electricity. They seem to get stronger by the minute.

LOIS: Daily Planet.

SUPERMAN: Lois. I have to go to Gotham to convince him to help me. 

LOIS: Who?

Diana goes to her laptop, checks her e-mail. A new message from "Wayne, Bruce" is there, titled "Boys Share Too".

BRUCE'S E-MAIL: Cracked Luthor's Drive, found your photography. But it doesn't belong to you...

Diana is intrigued. She scrolls down further...

BRUCE'S E-MAIL: Who are you? Where have you been?

Perry and Lois stare at each other for a while.

A shield activates, but Superman rips a manhole cover in half and hurls them at the shield.

SUPERMAN: You don't understand. There's no time!

BATMAN: I understand.

Superman pushes Batman back. Turrets fires. Superman flies up and destroys them with his heat vision.

SUPERMAN: Stay down! If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

Batman throws a smoke bomb, but Superman dashes through it, wonders where Batman is, grabs a second bomb, but it fires out green smoke causing him to choke.

BATMAN: Breathe it in. That's fear. You're not brave. Men are brave.

Batman and Superman began fighting which ended with Batman dragging Superman after another exposure to the green smoke.

BATMAN: I bet your parents taught you that you mean something. That you're here for a reason. My parents taught me a different lesson, dying in the gutter for no reason at all.

He hurls Superman at the pillars crashing into them.

BATMAN: They taught me the world only makes sense if you force it to. (He takes out the spear)

SUPERMAN: Find him. Save Martha.

Batman remembers his parents killed by a mugger.

THOMAS: Martha...

BATMAN: Why did you say that name? Martha! Why did you say that name?

LOIS LANE: Clark! Stop! Please! Stop!

BATMAN: Why did you say that name?

LOIS LANE: It's his mother's name. It's his mother's name.

ERIKA ERICKSON: We're not getting any answers. We're still right outside the containment center. A dangerous situation. Military and police personnel surrounded the area.

Cut to OUTSIDE WAREHOUSE As Batman looks for a place to land, Anatoli’s henchmen ready some miniguns…

GOONS: Go! Go!

…and fire onto the Batwing, with Batman responding with the airplane’s own weaponry, exploding a car and wiping out the goons. He flies a circle around the area.

BATMAN: You have to take it, Alfred. 

ALFRED: Ah, right. Commencing drone mode. Thermal images is showing me two dozen hostiles on the third floor. Why don't I drop you off on the second?

Batman crashes through a glass window of the warehouse. Anatoli's goons are waiting in front of a metal door until a hole exploded in the floor. A blur zips up and bombs are on the guns blowing them up. One goon fires at the hole until Batman defeats him. One goon pulls a pin from a grenade but Batman kicks him through the door leaving the goon to grab the grenade before it explodes.

ANATOLI: Drop it. I said drop it! I'll kill her. Believe me, I'll do it.

BATMAN: I believe you. [Gun fires at an gas pipe creating an fireball in the warehouse killing Anatoli]

Cut to: UPPER ATMOSPHERE Just as Superman brings Doomsday to the upper atmosphere, the beast punches him. After falling a bit, Superman flies back and tackles Doomsday. Once he sees the missile is coming, Superman grabs Doomsday by the neck to ensure the thing is hit by the nuclear bomb.

Cut to: METROPOLIS As the Batwing glides under a bridge, the sky gets lit.

BATMAN: Oh, God.

Once the Batwing flies higher, the blast has brightened the sky. The Daily Planet also witnesses it, and when it comes to Lois Lane watching it, something is also falling back to Earth, with great impact.

Cut to PENTAGON

FARRIS: Projectile 1. Impact. Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

SWANWICK: The shock waves are getting stronger. Every time we hit it, we make it more powerful. We can't attack.

PRESIDENT: What're you saying, Calvin?

SWANWICK: I'm saying it's unkillable.

Cut to STRYKER'S ISLAND The Batwing flies towards the charred island, and is witnessed by Doomsday. It charges a heat vision beam like Superman's and fires at the aircraft, narrowly missing as Batman flies away.

Cut to BATCAVE Alfred is checking on the Batwing surveillance monitors.

ALFRED: Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

BATMAN: Alfred. It's Kryptonian. Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.

ALFRED: They might, if you have any left.

BATMAN: [checking on the weapons] I only got 1 round left. The spear. Alfred, the spear. It's pure kryptonite. It's back in Gotham. If I can penetrate the skin, the spear will kill it.

ALFRED: It would in theory.

BATMAN: I got to get it to chase me. Back to the city. Back to the kryptonite.

Batman turns the Batwing around, fires a minigun at Doomsday. The beast eventually starts jumping after the plane, readying the eye beams.

Cut to: UPPER ATMOSPHERE The sunlight makes Superman heal itself and once he awakens, his eyes glow in a heat vision.

Cut to: METROPOLIS\GOTHAM SKIES

Doomsday jumps seeking the Batwing while shooting eye beams at it. One hits the wing, and the plane crashes.

Cut to OUTSIDE GOTHAM BUILDING Once it's downed, Batman tries to leave the aircraft, but gets stuck. Doomsday then slides down a building and arrives in front of the crashed plane.

BATMAN: Oh, shit.

As Doomsday readies his heat vision and Batman braces for impact, something jumps in front of the crashed Batwing, and absorbs the shot with no damage. Once the lights dissipate, it's revealed that it's Diana, in full WONDER WOMAN costume, her Amazonian bracelets still shining from the beam absorption. She grunts, and claps her wrists together, resulting in a sonic blast that pushes Doomsday backwards.

As Doomsday gets up again, Wonder Woman sees a shining thing falling from the sky. It's Superman, who tackles Doomsday into a nearby chemical silo. The place blows up, and triggers a chain reaction. Realizing the spear might be necessary, Lois rushes back to retrieve it. Batman gets out of the cockpit and starts getting weapons from the wreckage. Wonder Woman turns to him.

WONDER WOMAN: Why did you bring him back to the city?

BATMAN: The port is abandoned. There's a weapon here that can kill it.

Cut to GOTHAM BUILDING Lois is entering the pool.


Cut to OUTSIDE GOTHAM BUILDING After Batman grabs the shotgun and starts walking away, Superman lands in front of him.

SUPERMAN: Did you find the spear?

BATMAN: I've been a little busy.

WONDER WOMAN: This thing, this creature, seems to feed on energy.

Batman - who is loading the Kryptonite shells - and Superman walk towards Wonder Woman.

SUPERMAN: This thing is from another world. My world.

WONDER WOMAN: [drawing her sword] I've killed things from other worlds before.

Superman turns to Batman.

SUPERMAN: Is she with you?

BATMAN:  I thought she was with you.

The "Trinity" then strikes their battle pose, waiting for Doomsday to come.

Once Doomsday charges again, he releases a powerful energy blast, forcing Batman to take shelter below a piece of wreckage, Superman to raise his arm as a barrier, and Wonder Woman to protect herself with her shield, as the wave destroys more buildings – including the one where Lois has entered the water to retrieve the spear back. Once the wave dissipates, Doomsday is walking towards the heroes. Wonder Woman readies her sword and leaps to action, being followed by Superman, as Doomsday decides to jump at them too. Wonder Woman hits one of his shins, making Doomsday fly, and Superman bodyslams him to the ground. The beast rises as Diana tries hitting him with the sword, and then punches Superman away. Wonder Woman slices Doomsday’s foot, the beast throws a car at her, but she cuts it in half with her sword. Doomsday starts hitting Superman, eventually getting them close to where Batman has risen from his cover. Doomsday fires a heat beam at Wonder Woman, pushing her hard, making her dent the structure behind her with her body’s impact. She quickly recovers and runs for the beast. As Lois tries to break out of the water, Superman shoots his heat vision, being countered by Doomsday’s own, which overpowers him and throws Superman back to the ground. He then flies upwards, stands with a grimace on his face… until he hears Lois’s pounding. As Lois appears to have drowned, Superman breaks the wreckage and takes her out, leading her to cough. He touches her face before diving in to recover the spear. Elsewhere, Doomsday tries catching up with Batman, who is using his grappling gun to quickly avoid the beast. After hitting a building too fast, Batman falls on the fire stairs, and throws a smoke bomb while jumping away, avoiding the incoming Doomsday. As Doomsday returns to the ground, Lois sees the green glow approaching, along with a floating body…

LOIS: Clark!

She takes Superman out of the water, causing him to drop the Kryptonite spear.

LOIS: Clark!

She tosses it a short distance away before tending to Superman, who is conscious again.

LOIS: Clark! Clark! Are you alright?

Superman then sees Doomsday battling Wonder Woman. Diana is tossed backwards, but smiles before crawling for her sword. Doomsday jumps on her just as she arrives, but then she grabs the blade and cuts his hand. Doomsday then charges and shoots his beams at her. From the stump grows a single spike. Back to Lois and Clark witnessing the struggle.

SUPERMAN: I love you.

LOIS LANE: No. No, Clark, you can't.

SUPERMAN: This is my world.

LOIS LANE: No, Clark, don't.

SUPERMAN: You are my world.

LOIS LANE: No. Please. Clark!

Superman flies towards Doomsday, grabbing the spear along the way. Wonder Woman traps the charging Doomsday with her lasso, Batman fires his last Kryptonite grenade at him, and then Superman rushes and impales the creature with the Kryptonite spear, while the creature stabs Superman with the bone protrusions from the spike, seemingly killing him. Superman pushes the spear further into Doomsday, causing a beam to shoot into the sky. Both superpowered beings lie on the ground, lifeless. As Batman retrieves Superman’s dead body, Lois approaches, and Wonder Woman turns to look at her, giving her a sad look of empathy. Once Superman arrives, Lois cries, while touching his face and kissing him in the cheek. Fade to black.
